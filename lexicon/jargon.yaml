            \  And yet another convention common on early\n   line printers left zero\
            \ unornamented but added a tail or hook to the\n   letter-O so that it\
            \ resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O\n   (this was endorsed\

            \ final standard changed the distinguisher to a tick-mark\n   in the upper-left\

            \ \u2018pound\u2019,\n   compounding the American error).  The U.S. usage\
            \ derives from an\n   old-fashioned commercial practice of using a # suffix\
            \ to\n   tag pound weights on bills of lading.  The character is usually\
            \ pronounced\n   \u2018hash\u2019 outside the U.S.  There are more culture\
            \ wars over the\n   correct pronunciation of this character than any other,\
            \ which has led to\n   the ha ha only serious suggestion that it be\n\
            \   pronounced \u201Cshibboleth\u201D (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament\
            \ or\n   Tanakh).The \u2018uparrow\u2019 name for circumflex and\n   \u2018\
            leftarrow\u2019 name for underline are historical relics from\n   archaic\
            \ ASCII (the 1963 version), which had these graphics in those\n   character\
            \ positions rather than the modern punctuation characters.The \u2018swung\
            \ dash\u2019 or \u2018approximation\u2019 sign\n   (\u223C) is not quite\
            \ the same as tilde ~ in typeset material, but the ASCII\n   tilde serves\
            \ for both (compare angle brackets).\n   Some other common usages cause\
            \ odd overlaps.  The\n   #, $, >, and\n   & characters, for example, are\
            \ all pronounced\n   \u201Chex\u201D in different communities because\
            \ various assemblers use\n   them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants\
            \ (in particular,\n   # in many assembler-programming cultures,\n   $\
            \ in the 6502 world, > at Texas\n   Instruments, and & on the BBC Micro,\
            \ Sinclair, and\n   some Z80 machines).  See also splat.The inability\
            \ of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the world's\n   other major\
            \ languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more and\n   more\
            \ like a serious misfeature as the use of\n   international networks continues\
            \ to increase (see \n   software rot).\n   Hardware and software from\
            \ the U.S. still tends to\n   embody the assumption that ASCII is the\
            \ universal character set and that\n   characters have 7 bits; this is\
            \ a major irritant to people who want to use\n   a character set suited\
            \ to their own languages.  Perversely, though, efforts\n   to solve this\
            \ problem by proliferating \u2018national\u2019 character\n   sets produce\
            \ an evolutionary pressure to use a smaller\n   subset common to all those\

            \ FORTRAN DO looks\n   like a COME FROM statement.  After the\n   terminating\
            \ statement number/CONTINUE is\n   reached, control continues at the statement\
            \ following the DO.  Some\n   generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary\
            \ statements (other than CONTINUE) for the statement, leading to examples\n\
            \   like:\n      DO 10 I=1,LIMIT\nC imagine many lines of code here, leaving\
            \ the\nC original DO statement lost in the spaghetti...\n      WRITE(6,10)\
            \ I,FROB(I)\n 10   FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4)\nin which the trapdoor is just\
            \ after the statement labeled 10.  (This\n   is particularly surprising\
            \ because the label doesn't appear to have\n   anything to do with the\
            \ flow of control at all!)  While sufficiently\n   astonishing to the\
            \ unsuspecting reader, this form of COME FROM statement isn't completely\
            \ general.  After\n   all, control will eventually pass to the following\
            \ statement.  The\n   implementation of the general form was left to Univac\
            \ FORTRAN, ca. 1975\n   (though a roughly similar feature existed on the\
            \ IBM 7040 ten years\n   earlier).  The statement AT 100 would\n   perform\
            \ a COME FROM 100.  It was intended\n   strictly as a debugging aid, with\
            \ dire consequences promised to anyone so\n   deranged as to use it in\

            \ for the PDP-1\ncomputer in 1961.  At that time DDT stood for \u201C\
            DEC Debugging\nTape\u201D.  Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging\
            \ program has\npropagated throughout the computer industry.  DDT programs\
            \ are now\navailable for all DEC computers.  Since media other than tape\
            \ are\nnow frequently used, the more descriptive name \u201CDynamic Debugging\n\
            Technique\u201D has been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation.  Confusion\n\

            \ direct ancestor of the PDP-1\n   built at MIT's Lincoln Lab in 1957.\
            \  The debugger on that ground-breaking\n   machine (the first transistorized\

            \ assuming you meant 'delete\n   *'. It then started to delete all the\

            \ which\n   is the most evenly distributed.  This is because the\n   world\

            \   will not be in the state of lowest energy, but in the state of lowest\n\
            \   disordered energy.Item 81 (Rich Schroeppel): Count the magic squares\
            \ of order 5 (that\n   is, all the 5-by-5 arrangements of the numbers\
            \ from 1 to 25 such that all\n   rows, columns, and diagonals add up to\
            \ the same number).  There are about\n   320 million, not counting those\
            \ that differ only by rotation and\n   reflection.Item 154 (Bill Gosper):\
            \ The myth that any given programming language\n   is machine independent\
            \ is easily exploded by computing the sum of powers of\n   2.  If the\
            \ result loops with period = 1\n   with sign +, you are on a sign-magnitude\n\
            \   machine.  If the result loops with period =\n   1 at -1, you are on\
            \ a\n   twos-complement machine.  If the result loops with period greater\
            \ than 1,\n   including the beginning, you are on a ones-complement machine.\
            \  If the\n   result loops with period greater than 1, not including the\
            \ beginning, your\n   machine isn't binary \u2014 the pattern should tell\
            \ you the base.  If you\n   run out of memory, you are on a string or\
            \ bignum system.  If arithmetic\n   overflow is a fatal error, some fascist\
            \ pig with a read-only mind is trying\n   to enforce machine independence.\
            \  But the very ability to trap overflow is\n   machine dependent.  By\
            \ this strategy, consider the universe, or, more\n   precisely, algebra:\
            \ Let X = the sum of\n   many powers of 2 = ...111111 (base 2).  Now add\n\
            \   X to itself: X + X\n   = ...111110.  Thus, 2X = X -\n   1, so X =\
            \ -1.  Therefore\n   algebra is run on a machine (the universe) that is\
            \ two's-complement.Item 174 (Bill Gosper and Stuart Nelson): 21963283741\
            \ is the only\n   number such that if you represent it on the PDP-10\n\
            \   as both an integer and a floating-point number, the bit patterns of\
            \ the two\n   representations are identical.Item 176 (Gosper): The \u201C\
            banana phenomenon\u201D was\n   encountered when processing a character\
            \ string by taking the last 3 letters\n   typed out, searching for a random\
            \ occurrence of that sequence in the text,\n   taking the letter following\
            \ that occurrence, typing it out, and iterating.\n   This ensures that\
            \ every 4-letter string output occurs in the original.  The\n   program\
            \ typed BANANANANANANANA.... We note an ambiguity in the\n   phrase, \u201C\
            the Nth occurrence\n   of.\u201D In one sense, there are five 00's in\
            \ 0000000000; in another,\n   there are nine.  The editing program TECO\
            \ finds five.  Thus it finds only\n   the first ANA in BANANA, and is\
            \ thus obligated to type N next.  By Murphy's\n   Law, there is but one\
            \ NAN, thus forcing A, and thus a loop.  An option to\n   find overlapped\

            \ mail quickly\n   grew to dominate actual usage.  Universities, research\
            \ labs and defense\n   contractors early discovered the Internet's potential\
            \ as a medium of\n   communication between humans and linked up in steadily\n\
            \   increasing numbers, connecting together a quirky mix of academics,\
            \ techies,\n   hippies, SF fans, hackers, and anarchists.  The roots of\
            \ this lexicon lie\n   in those early years.Over the next quarter-century\
            \ the Internet evolved in many ways. The\n   typical machine/OS combination\
            \ moved from DEC\nPDP-10s and PDP-20s, running\n   TOPS-10 and TOPS-20,\
            \ to\n   PDP-11s and VAXen and Suns running\n   Unix, and in the 1990s\
            \ to Unix on Intel\n   microcomputers.  The Internet's protocols grew\
            \ more capable, most notably\n   in the move from NCP/IP to TCP/IP in\
            \ 1982 and the\n   implementation of Domain Name Service in 1983.  It\
            \ was around this time\n   that people began referring to the collection\
            \ of interconnected networks\n   with ARPANET at its core as \u201Cthe\
            \ Internet\u201D.The ARPANET had a fairly strict set of participation\
            \ guidelines --\n   connected institutions had to be involved with a DOD-related\
            \ research\n   project.  By the mid-80s, many of the organizations clamoring\
            \ to join\n   didn't fit this profile.  In 1986, the National Science\
            \ Foundation built\n   NSFnet to open up access to its five regional supercomputing\
            \ centers;\n   NSFnet became the backbone of the Internet, replacing the\
            \ original ARPANET\n   pipes (which were formally shut down in 1990).\
            \  Between 1990 and late 1994\n   the pieces of NSFnet were sold to major\
            \ telecommunications companies until\n   the Internet backbone had gone\
            \ completely commercial.That year, 1994, was also the year the mainstream\
            \ culture discovered\n   the Internet.  Once again, the killer app was\
            \ not\n   the anticipated one \u2014 rather, what caught the public imagination\
            \ was\n   the hypertext and multimedia features of the World Wide Web.\
            \  Subsequently\n   the Internet has seen off its only serious challenger\
            \ (the OSI protocol\n   stack favored by European telecoms monopolies)\
            \ and is in the process of\n   absorbing into itself many of the proprietary\
            \ networks built during the\n   second wave of wide-area networking after\
            \ 1980.  By 1996 it had become a\n   commonplace even in mainstream media\

        section_4: "Historically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with names of\
            \ MU-\n   form) derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw\
            \ on the\n   University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants\
            \ of that game\n   still exist today and are sometimes generically called\n\
            \   BartleMUDs.  There is a widespread myth (repeated,\n   unfortunately,\
            \ by earlier versions of this lexicon) that the name MUD was\n   trademarked\
            \ to the commercial MUD run by Bartle on British Telecom (the\n   motto:\
            \ \u201CYou haven't lived 'til you've\n   died on MUD!\u201D); however,\
            \ this is false \u2014\n   Richard Bartle explicitly placed \u2018MUD\u2019\
            \ in the public domain in\n   1985.  BT was upset at this, as they had\
            \ already printed trademark claims\n   on some maps and posters, which\
            \ were released and created the myth.Students on the European academic\
            \ networks quickly improved on the\n   MUD concept, spawning several new\
            \ MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD).  Many of\n   these had associated bulletin-board\
            \ systems for social interaction.\n   Because these had an image as \u2018\
            research\u2019 they often survived\n   administrative hostility to BBSs\
            \ in general.  This, together with the fact\n   that Usenet feeds were\
            \ often spotty and difficult to get in the U.K., made\n   the MUDs major\
            \ foci of hackish social interaction there.AberMUD and other variants\
            \ crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and\n   quickly gained popularity in\
            \ the U.S.; they became nuclei for large hacker\n   communities with only\
            \ loose ties to traditional hackerdom (some observers\n   see parallels\
            \ with the growth of Usenet in the early 1980s).  The second\n   wave\
            \ of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants) tended to emphasize social interaction,\n\
            \   puzzles, and cooperative world-building as opposed to combat and\n\
            \   competition (in writing, these social MUDs are sometimes referred\
            \ to as\n   \u2018MU*\u2019, with \u2018MUD\u2019 implicitly reserved\
            \ for the more\n   game-oriented ones).  By 1991, over 50% of MUD sites\
            \ were of a third major\n   variety, LPMUD, which synthesizes the combat/puzzle\
            \ aspects of AberMUD and\n   older systems with the extensibility of TinyMud.\
            \  In 1996 the cutting edge\n   of the technology is Pavel Curtis's MOO,\
            \ even more extensible using a\n   built-in object-oriented language.\
            \  The trend toward greater\n   programmability and flexibility will doubtless\
            \ continue.The state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly,\
            \ with\n   new simulation designs appearing (seemingly) every month. \
            \ Around 1991\n   there was an unsuccessful movement to deprecate the\
            \ term\n   MUD itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding\n   variety\
            \ of names corresponding to the different simulation styles being\n  \
            \ explored.  It survived.  See also bonk/oif,\n   FOD, link-dead,\n  \

            \ SC-30M, the small\n   uniprocessor SC-25, and the never-built superprocessor\
            \ SC-40.  These\n   machines were marvels of engineering design; although\

            \ or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4 machines.  They were also completely\n  \
            \ compatible with the DEC KL10, and ran all KL10 binaries (including the\n\
            \   operating system) with no modifications at about 2--3 times faster\
            \ than a\n   KL10.When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983 (their\
            \ followup to the\n   PDP-10), Systems Concepts should have made a bundle\
            \ selling their machine\n   into shops with a lot of software investment\

            \ with the likes of Sun\n   Microsystems and other hungry startups building\
            \ workstations with power\n   comparable to the KL10 at a fraction of\
            \ the price.  By the time SC shipped\n   the first SC-30M to Stanford\

        section_1: "[proposed] Several of the key Internet RFCs,\n   especially 1122\
            \ and 791 contain a piece of advice due to Jon Postel, \n   which is most\
            \ often stated as:\u201CBe liberal in what you accept, and conservative\
            \ in what you\n   send.\u201DThat is, a well-engineered implementation\
            \ of any of the\n   Internet protocols should be willing to deal with\
            \ marginal\n   and imperfectly-formed inputs, but should not assume that\
            \ the\n   program on the other end (that is, the program dealing with\
            \ the\n   well-engineered implementation's output) will be anything other\n\
            \   than rigid and inflexible, and perhaps even incomplete or downright\n\
            \   buggy.This property is valuable because a network of programs adhering\n\
            \   to it will be much more robust in the presence of any uncertainties\n\
            \   in the protocol specifications, or any individual implementor's\n\
            \   failure to understand those specifications perfectly.  Though the\n\
            \   policy does tend to accommodate broken implementations it is held\n\
            \   to more important to get the communication flowing than to\n   immediately\
            \ (but terminally) diagnose the broken implementations\n   at the expense\
            \ of the people trying to use them.The principle is a well-known one in\
            \ the design of programs\n   that handle Internet wire protocols, especially\
            \ network\n   relays and servers, and it is regularly applied by extension\n\
            \   in any situation where two or more separately-implemented\n   pieces\
            \ of software are supposed to interoperate even though the\n   various\
            \ implementors have never talked to each other and have\n   absolutely\
            \ nothing whatsoever in common other than having\n   all read the same\
            \ protocol specification.  The principle travels\n   under several different\

            \ first\n   RFC editor\n   and (until his untimely death) probably the\

            \ \u2014 under a constraint now long\n   obsolete.  In early typewriters,\
            \ fast typing using nearby type-bars jammed\n   the mechanism.  So Sholes\
            \ fiddled the layout to separate the letters of\n   many common digraphs\
            \ (he did a far from perfect job, though;\n   \u2018th\u2019, \u2018tr\u2019\
            , \u2018ed\u2019, and \u2018er\u2019,\n   for example, each use two nearby\
            \ keys).  Also, putting the letters of\n   \u2018typewriter\u2019 on one\
            \ line allowed it to be typed with particular\n   speed and accuracy for\
            \ demos.  The jamming problem\n   was essentially solved soon afterward\
            \ by a suitable use of springs, but the\n   keyboard layout lives on.The\
            \ QWERTY keyboard has also spawned some unhelpful economic myths\n   about\
            \ how technical standards get and stay established; see http://www.reasonmag.com/9606/Fe.QWERTY.html."

            wreath\u2019; this part of the story may be apocryphal).\n   Ultimately\
            \ DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it\n   was\
            \ as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The hacker community, mindful of its\n\

            \   TENEX\u2019), even though by this point very little of the original\
            \ TENEX\n   code remained (analogously to the differences between AT&T\
            \ V6 Unix and\n   BSD).  DEC people cringed when they heard \u201CTWENEX\u201D\
            , but the\n   term caught on nevertheless (the written abbreviation \u2018\
            20x\u2019 was\n   also used).  TWENEX was successful and very popular;\
            \ in fact, there was a\n   period in the early 1980s when it commanded\

            \ that seems to have originated with the\n   Teletype ASR-33 and remained\
            \ common for several years on early computer\n   equipment.  The ASR-33\
            \ was a mechanical device (see\n   EOU), so the only way to generate the\
            \ character\n   codes from keystrokes was by some physical linkage.  The\
            \ design of the\n   ASR-33 assigned each character key a basic pattern\
            \ that could be modified\n   by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL\
            \ key was pressed.  In order to\n   avoid making the thing even more of\
            \ a kluge than it already was, the design\n   had to group characters\
            \ that shared the same basic bit pattern on one\n   key.Looking at the\
            \ ASCII chart, we find:\nhigh  low bits\nbits  0000 0001 0010 0011 0100\
            \ 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001\n 010        !    \"    #    $    %    &  \

            This is why the characters !\"#$%&'() appear where they do on a\n   Teletype\
            \ (thankfully, they didn't use shift-0 for space). The Teletype\n   Model\
            \ 33 was actually designed before ASCII existed, and was originally\n\
            \   intended to use a code that contained these two rows:\n      low bits\n\
            high  0000  0010  0100  0110  1000  1010  1100  1110\nbits     0001  0011\

            \ keyboard.\n   But as it happened, Teletype had to use a lot of persuasion\
            \ just to keep\n   ASCII, and the Model 33 keyboard, from looking like\
            \ this instead:\n          !  \"  ?  $  '  &  -  (  )  ;  :  *  /  , \

            \ arrangements on IBM's even\n   clunkier 026 and 029 card punches.When\
            \ electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there\n   was\
            \ no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be laid out.\n\
            \   Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard, while others\
            \ used the\n   flexibility of electronic circuitry to make their product\
            \ look like an\n   office typewriter.  Either choice was supported by\
            \ the ANSI computer\n   keyboard standard, X4.14-1971, which referred\
            \ to the alternatives as\n   \u201Clogical bit pairing\u201D and \u201C\
            typewriter\n   pairing\u201D. These alternatives became known as bit-paired\
            \ and typewriter-paired keyboards.  To a hacker, the\n   bit-paired keyboard\
            \ seemed far more logical \u2014 and because most\n   hackers in those\
            \ days had never learned to touch-type, there was little\n   pressure\
            \ from the pioneering users to adapt keyboards to the typewriter\n   standard.The\
            \ doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale introduction\n \
            \  of the computer terminal into the normal office environment, where\n\
            \   out-and-out technophobes were expected to use the equipment.  The\
            \ typewriter-paired standard became universal,\n   X4.14 was superseded\
            \ by X4.23-1982, bit-paired hardware was quickly junked or\n   relegated\
            \ to dusty corners, and both terms passed into disuse.However, in countries\
            \ without a long history of touch typing, the\n   argument against the\
            \ bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or nonexistent. As\n   a result,\
            \ the standard Japanese keyboard, used on PCs, Unix boxen\n   etc. still\
            \ has all of the !\"#$%&'() characters above the numbers in the\n   ASR-33\

            \ nostalgic for blinkenlights because\n   they were so much more fun to\
            \ look at than a blank panel.  Sadly, very few\n   computers still have\
            \ them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard certainly don't\n   count). The\
            \ obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost of front-panel cutouts,\n   almost\
            \ nobody needs or wants to interpret machine-register states on the\n\
            \   fly anymore) are only part of the story.  Another part of it is that\n\
            \   radio-frequency leakage from the lamp wiring was beginning to be a\
            \ problem\n   as far back as transistor machines.  But the most fundamental\
            \ fact is that\n   there are very few signals slow enough to blink an\
            \ LED these days!  With\n   slow CPUs, you could watch the bus register\
            \ or instruction counter tick,\n   but even at 33/66/150MHz (let alone\
            \ gigahertz speeds) it's all a\n   blur.Despite this, a couple of relatively\
            \ recent computer designs of note\n   have featured programmable blinkenlights\
            \ that were added just because they\n   looked cool.  The Connection Machine,\
            \ a 65,536-processor parallel computer\n   designed in the mid-1980s,\
            \ was a black cube with one side covered with a\n   grid of red blinkenlights;\
            \ the sales demo had them evolving\n   life patterns.  A few years later\
            \ the ill-fated\n   BeBox (a personal computer designed to run the BeOS\
            \ operating system)\n   featured twin rows of blinkenlights on the case\
            \ front. When Be,\n   Inc. decided to get out of the hardware business\
            \ in 1996 and instead ported\n   their OS to the PowerPC and later to\
            \ the Intel architecture, many users\n   suffered severely from the absence\
            \ of their beloved blinkenlights.  Before\n   long an external version\
            \ of the blinkenlights driven by a PC serial port\n   became available;\
            \ there is some sort of plot symmetry in the fact that it\n   was assembled\
            \ by a German.Finally, a version updated for the Internet has been seen\

            \ reports that the word\n   \u2018blinkenlights\u2019 is (in 1999) undergoing\
            \ something of a revival\n   in usage, but applied to networking equipment.\
            \ The transmit and receive\n   lights on routers, activity lights on switches\
            \ and hubs, and other network\n   equipment often blink in visually pleasing\
            \ and seemingly coordinated\n   ways. Although this is different in some\
            \ ways from register readings, a\n   tall stack of Cisco equipment or\
            \ a 19-inch rack of ISDN terminals can\n   provoke a similar feeling of\
            \ hypnotic awe, especially in a darkened network\n   operations center\
            \ or server room.The ancestor of the original blinkenlights posters of\
            \ the 1950s was\n   probably this:WWII-era machine-shop posterWe are informed\
            \ that cod-German parodies of this kind were very \n   common in Allied\
            \ machine shops during and following WWII.  Germans,\n   then as now,\
            \ had a reputation for being both good with precision\n   machinery and\

            Bob\u201D, despite the fact that no \u201CBob\u201D was\n   currently\

            \ \u2018original bug\u2019 (the caption date is incorrect)Indeed, the\
            \ use of bug to mean\n   an industrial defect was already established\
            \ in Thomas Edison's time, and a\n   more specific and rather modern use\
            \ can be found in an electrical handbook\n   from 1896 (Hawkin's New Catechism\
            \ of Electricity,\n   Theo. Audel & Co.)  which says: \u201CThe term \u2018\
            bug\u2019 is\n   used to a limited extent to designate any fault or trouble\
            \ in the\n   connections or working of electric apparatus.\u201D It further\
            \ notes that\n   the term is \u201Csaid to have originated in quadruplex\
            \ telegraphy and\n   have been transferred to all electric apparatus.\u201D\
            The latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the\n  \
            \ term; that it came from telephone company usage, in which \u201Cbugs\
            \ in a\n   telephone cable\u201D were blamed for noisy lines.  Though\
            \ this\n   derivation seems to be mistaken, it may well be a distorted\
            \ memory of a\n   joke first current among telegraph operators more than\n\
            \   a century ago!Or perhaps not a joke.  Historians of the field inform\
            \ us that the\n   term \u201Cbug\u201D was regularly used in the early\
            \ days of telegraphy\n   to refer to a variety of semi-automatic telegraphy\
            \ keyers that would send a\n   string of dots if you held them down. \
            \ In fact, the Vibroplex keyers (which\n   were among the most common\
            \ of this type) even had a graphic of a beetle on\n   them (and still\
            \ do)!  While the ability to send repeated dots automatically\n   was\
            \ very useful for professional morse code operators, these were also\n\
            \   significantly trickier to use than the older manual keyers, and it\
            \ could\n   take some practice to ensure one didn't introduce extraneous\
            \ dots into the\n   code by holding the key down a fraction too long.\
            \  In the hands of an\n   inexperienced operator, a Vibroplex \u201Cbug\u201D\
            \ on the line could\n   mean that a lot of garbled Morse would soon be\
            \ coming your way.Further, the term \u201Cbug\u201D has long been used\
            \ among radio\n   technicians to describe a device that converts electromagnetic\
            \ field\n   variations into acoustic signals.  It is used to trace radio\
            \ interference\n   and look for dangerous radio emissions.  Radio community\
            \ usage derives from\n   the roach-like shape of the first versions used\
            \ by 19th century physicists.\n   The first versions consisted of a coil\
            \ of wire (roach body), with the two\n   wire ends sticking out and bent\
            \ back to nearly touch forming a spark gap\n   (roach antennae).  The\

            \ scholars).\n   \u2018The canon\u2019 is the body of works in a\n   given\
            \ field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of music) deemed\n \
            \  worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to investigate.The\
            \ word \u2018canon\u2019 has an interesting history.  It derives\n   ultimately\
            \ from the Greek\n   \u03BA\u03B1\u03BD\u03BF\u03BD (akin to the\n   English\
            \ \u2018cane\u2019) referring to a reed.  Reeds were used for\n   measurement,\
            \ and in Latin and later Greek the word \u2018canon\u2019\n   meant a\
            \ rule or a standard.  The establishment of a canon of scriptures\n  \
            \ within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a rule for the\n\
            \   religion.  The above non-techspeak academic usages stem from this\
            \ instance\n   of a defined and accepted body of work.  Alongside this\
            \ usage was the\n   promulgation of \u2018canons\u2019 (\u2018rules\u2019\
            ) for the\n   government of the Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages\
            \ (\u201Caccording\n   to religious law\u201D) derive from this use of\
            \ the Latin\n   \u2018canon\u2019.Hackers invest this term with a playfulness\
            \ that makes an ironic\n   contrast with its historical meaning.  A true\
            \ story: One Bob Sjoberg, new\n   at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance\
            \ at the incessant use of jargon.\n   Over his loud objections, GLS and\
            \ RMS made a point of using as much of it\n   as possible in his presence,\
            \ and eventually it began to sink in.  Finally,\n   in one conversation,\
            \ he used the word canonical in jargon-like fashion without\n   thinking.\
            \  Steele: \u201CAha!  We've finally got you talking jargon\n   too!\u201D\
            \ Stallman: \u201CWhat did he say?\u201D Steele: \u201CBob\n   just used\

            \   located primarily in Scandinavia and northern Europe. Demoscene folklore\n\
            \   recounts that when old-time warez d00dz cracked some\n   piece of\
            \ software they often added an advertisement in the beginning,\n   usually\
            \ containing colorful display hacks with\n   greetings to other cracking\
            \ groups.  The demoscene was born among people\n   who decided building\
            \ these display hacks is more interesting than hacking\n   \u2014 or anyway\
            \ safer.  Around 1990 there began to be very serious police\n   pressure\
            \ on cracking groups, including raids with SWAT teams crashing into\n\
            \   bedrooms to confiscate computers.  Whether in response to this or\
            \ for\n   esthetic reasons, crackers of that period began to build self-contained\n\
            \   display hacks of considerable elaboration and beauty (within the culture\n\
            \   such a hack is called a demo).  As more of these\n   demogroups emerged,\
            \ they started to have\n   compos at copying parties (see\n   copyparty),\
            \ which later evolved to standalone events\n   (see demoparty).  The demoscene\
            \ has retained some\n   traits from the warez d00dz, including their style\n\
            \   of handles and group names and some of their jargon.Traditionally\
            \ demos were written in assembly language, with lots of\n   smart tricks,\
            \ self-modifying code, undocumented op-codes and the like.\n   Some time\
            \ around 1995, people started coding demos in C, and a couple of\n   years\
            \ after that, they also started using Java.Ten years on (in 1998-1999),\
            \ the demoscene is changing as its\n   original platforms (C64, Amiga,\
            \ Spectrum, Atari ST, IBM PC under DOS) die\n   out and activity shifts\
            \ towards Windows, Linux, and the Internet.  While\n   deeply underground\
            \ in the past, demoscene is trying to get into the\n   mainstream as accepted\
            \ art form, and one symptom of this is the\n   commercialization of bigger\
            \ demoparties. Older demosceners frown at this,\n   but the majority think\
            \ it's a good direction.  Many demosceners end up\n   working in the computer\

            .  The\n   word \u201Cfoo\u201D frequently appeared on license plates\
            \ of cars, in\n   nonsense sayings in the background of some frames (such\
            \ as \u201CHe who\n   foos last foos best\u201D or \u201CMany smoke but\

            \ Companion Holman claimed to have found the\n   word \u201Cfoo\u201D\
            \ on the bottom of a Chinese figurine.  This is\n   plausible; Chinese\
            \ statuettes often have apotropaic inscriptions, and this\n   one was\
            \ almost certainly the Mandarin Chinese word\n   fu (sometimes transliterated\n\
            \   foo), which can mean\n   \u201Chappiness\u201D or \u201Cprosperity\u201D\
            \ when spoken with the\n   rising tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking\

            \ nonsense word was undoubtedly\n   influenced by Yiddish \u2018feh\u2019\

            \   popular songs and generating over 500 \u2018Foo Clubs.\u2019 The fad\
            \ left\n   \u2018foo\u2019 references embedded in popular culture (including\
            \ a\n   couple of appearances in Warner Brothers cartoons of 1938-39;\
            \ notably in\n   Robert Clampett's \u201CDaffy Doc\u201D of 1938, in which\
            \ a very early\n   version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying \u201C\
            SILENCE IS\n   FOO!\u201D) When the fad faded, the origin of \u201Cfoo\u201D\
            \ was\n   forgotten.One place \u201Cfoo\u201D is known to have remained\
            \ live is in the\n   U.S. military during the WWII years.  In 1944-45,\

            \ for the kind of mysterious or\n   spurious trace that would later be\
            \ called a UFO (the older term resurfaced\n   in popular American usage\
            \ in 1995 via the name of one of the better\n   grunge-rock bands).  Because\
            \ informants connected the term directly to the\n   Smokey Stover strip,\
            \ the folk etymology that connects it to French\n   \u201Cfeu\u201D (fire)\
            \ can be gently dismissed.The U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped\
            \ slang terms during\n   the war (see kluge and kludge\n   for another\
            \ important example) Period sources reported that\n   \u2018FOO\u2019\
            \ became a semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army\n   graffiti more\
            \ or less equivalent to the American Kilroy.  Where British\n   troops\
            \ went, the graffito \u201CFOO was here\u201D or something similar\n \
            \  showed up.  Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came\
            \ from\n   Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous\n\
            \   \u201CFUBAR\u201D) was probably a backronym .\n   Forty years later,\
            \ Paul Dickson's excellent book \u201CWords\u201D\n   (Dell, 1982, ISBN\
            \ 0-440-52260-7) traced \u201CFoo\u201D to an\n   unspecified British\
            \ naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows:\n   \u201CMr. Foo is a mysterious\
            \ Second World War product, gifted with bitter\n   omniscience and sarcasm.\u201D\
            Earlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that hacker\n\
            \   usage actually sprang from FOO, Lampoons and Parody,\n   the title\
            \ of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint project\n  \
            \ of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in his mid-teens)\n\
            \   later became one of the most important and influential artists in\n\
            \   underground comics, this venture was hardly a success; indeed, the\
            \ brothers\n   later burned most of the existing copies in disgust.  The\
            \ title FOO was\n   featured in large letters on the front cover.  However,\
            \ very few copies of\n   this comic actually circulated, and students\
            \ of Crumb's\n   oeuvre have established that this title was\n   a reference\
            \ to the earlier Smokey Stover comics.  The Crumbs may also have\n   been\
            \ influenced by a short-lived Canadian parody magazine named\n   \u2018\
            Foo\u2019 published in 1951-52.An old-time member reports that in the\
            \ 1959 Dictionary of\n   the TMRC Language, compiled at TMRC,\n   there\
            \ was an entry that went something like this:\nFOO: The first syllable\
            \ of the sacred chant phrase \u201CFOO MANE PADME\nHUM.\u201D Our first\
            \ obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.\n(For more about the\
            \ legendary foo counters, see\n   TMRC.)  This definition used Bill Holman's\
            \ nonsense\n   word, then only two decades old and demonstrably still\
            \ live in popular\n   culture and slang, to a ha ha only serious analogy\n\
            \   with esoteric Tibetan Buddhism.  Today's hackers would find it difficult\

            \ it was titled How to Design a\n   Kludge (February 1962, pp. 30, 31).\
            \  This spelling was probably\n   imported from Great Britain, where kludge\
            \ has an\n   independent history (though this fact was largely unknown\
            \ to hackers on\n   either side of the Atlantic before a mid-1993 debate\

            \   \u2018kluge\u2019 crossed the Atlantic, repaid the U.S. by lobbing\
            \ the\n   \u2018kludge\u2019 orthography in the other direction and confusing\
            \ their\n   American cousins' spelling!The result of this history is a\
            \ tangle.  Many younger U.S. hackers\n   pronounce the word as /klooj/\
            \ but\n   spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as\n\
            \   \u2018kludge\u2019. (Phonetically, consider huge, refuge, centrifuge,\
            \ and\n   deluge as opposed to sludge, judge, budge, and fudge.  Whatever\
            \ its\n   failings in other areas, English spelling is perfectly consistent\
            \ about\n   this distinction.)  British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/\
            \ orally, use it in a restricted\n   negative sense and are at least consistent.\
            \  European hackers have mostly\n   learned the word from written American\

            \ to\n   it frequently in his own postings, and at one point twitted some\

            \ of the moon.  There was a little subroutine that had\n   traditionally\
            \ been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an\n   approximation\
            \ to the moon's true phase.  GLS incorporated this routine into\n   a\
            \ LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would print a timestamp\
            \ line\n   almost 80 characters long.  Very occasionally the first line\
            \ of the message\n   would be too long and would overflow onto the next\
            \ line, and when the file\n   was later read back in the program would\
            \ barf.  The\n   length of the first line depended on both the precise\
            \ date and time and the\n   length of the phase specification when the\
            \ timestamp was printed, and so\n   the bug literally depended on the\
            \ phase of the moon!The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983)\
            \ included an\n   example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited\
            \ this bug, but the\n   typesetter \u2018corrected\u2019 it.  This has\
            \ since been described as\n   the phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.However, beware\
            \ of assumptions.  A few years ago, engineers of CERN\n   (European Center\
            \ for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors in\n   experiments\
            \ conducted with the LEP particle accelerator.  As the formidable\n  \
            \ amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed by computers\n\
            \   before being seen by humans, many people suggested the software was\
            \ somehow\n   sensitive to the phase of the moon.  A few desperate engineers\
            \ discovered\n   the truth; the error turned out to be the result of a\
            \ tiny change in the\n   geometry of the 27km circumference ring, physically\
            \ caused by the\n   deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon!\

            \   Steele:Jon L. White (login name JONL) and I (GLS) were office mates\
            \ at MIT\n   for many years.  One April, we both flew from Boston to California\
            \ for a\n   week on research business, to consult face-to-face with some\
            \ people at\n   Stanford, particularly our mutual friend Richard P.  Gabriel\
            \ (RPG).RPG picked us up at the San Francisco airport and drove us back\
            \ to\n   Palo Alto (going logical south on route 101,\n   parallel to\
            \ El Camino Bignum).  Palo Alto is\n   adjacent to Stanford University\
            \ and about 40 miles south of San Francisco.\n   We ate at The Good Earth,\
            \ a \u2018health food\u2019 restaurant, very\n   popular, the sort whose\
            \ milkshakes all contain honey and protein powder.\n   JONL ordered such\
            \ a shake \u2014 the waitress claimed the flavor of the\n   day was \u201C\
            lalaberry\u201D.  I still have no idea what that might be,\n   but it\
            \ became a running joke.  It was the color of raspberry, and JONL said\n\
            \   it tasted rather bitter.  I ate a better tostada there than I have\
            \ ever had\n   in a Mexican restaurant.After this we went to the local\
            \ Uncle Gaylord's Old Fashioned Ice\n   Cream Parlor.  They make ice cream\
            \ fresh daily, in a variety of intriguing\n   flavors.  It's a chain,\
            \ and they have a slogan: \u201CIf you don't live\n   near an Uncle Gaylord's\
            \ \u2014 MOVE!\u201D Also, Uncle Gaylord (a real\n   person) wages a constant\
            \ battle to force big-name ice cream makers to print\n   their ingredients\
            \ on the package (like air and plastic and other\n   non-natural garbage).\
            \  JONL and I had first discovered Uncle Gaylord's the\n   previous August,\
            \ when we had flown to a computer-science conference in\n   Berkeley,\
            \ California, the first time either of us had been on the West\n   Coast.\
            \  When not in the conference sessions, we had spent our time\n   wandering\
            \ the length of Telegraph Avenue, which (like Harvard Square in\n   Cambridge)\
            \ was lined with picturesque street vendors and interesting little\n \
            \  shops.  On that street we discovered Uncle Gaylord's Berkeley store.\
            \  The\n   ice cream there was very good.  During that August visit JONL\
            \ went\n   absolutely bananas (so to speak) over one particular flavor,\
            \ ginger\n   honey.Therefore, after eating at The Good Earth \u2014 indeed,\
            \ after every\n   lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit\
            \ \u2014 a trip to\n   Uncle Gaylord's (the one in Palo Alto) was mandatory.\
            \  We had arrived on a\n   Wednesday, and by Thursday evening we had been\
            \ there at least four times.\n   Each time, JONL would get ginger honey\
            \ ice cream, and proclaim to all\n   bystanders that \u201CGinger was\
            \ the spice that drove the Europeans mad!\n   That's why they sought a\
            \ route to the East!  They used it to preserve their\n   otherwise off-taste\
            \ meat.\u201D After the third or fourth repetition RPG\n   and I were\
            \ getting a little tired of this spiel, and began to paraphrase\n   him:\
            \ \u201CWow!  Ginger!  The spice that makes rotten meat taste\n   good!\u201D\
            \ \u201CSay!  Why don't we find some dog that's been run over\n   and\
            \ sat in the sun for a week and put some ginger on\n   it for dinner?!\u201D\
            \ \u201CRight!  With a lalaberry shake!\u201D And\n   so on.  This failed\
            \ to faze JONL; he took it in good humor, as long as we\n   kept returning\
            \ to Uncle Gaylord's.  He loves ginger honey ice cream.Now RPG and his\
            \ then-wife KBT (Kathy Tracy) were putting us up\n   (putting up with\
            \ us?) in their home for our visit, so to thank them JONL\n   and I took\
            \ them out to a nice French restaurant of their choosing.  I\n   unadventurously\
            \ chose the filet mignon, and KBT had je\n   ne sais quoi du jour, but\
            \ RPG and JONL had lapin (rabbit).  (Waitress: \u201COui, we have fresh\
            \ rabbit, fresh today.\u201D RPG:\n   \u201CWell, JONL, I guess we won't\
            \ need any\n   ginger!\u201D)We finished the meal late, about 11PM, which\
            \ is 2AM Boston time, so\n   JONL and I were rather droopy.  But it wasn't\
            \ yet midnight.  Off to Uncle\n   Gaylord's!Now the French restaurant\
            \ was in Redwood City, north of Palo Alto.\n   In leaving Redwood City,\
            \ we somehow got onto route 101 going north instead\n   of south.  JONL\
            \ and I wouldn't have known the difference had RPG not\n   mentioned it.\
            \  We still knew very little of the local geography.  I did\n   figure\
            \ out, however, that we were headed in the direction of Berkeley, and\n\
            \   half-jokingly suggested that we continue north and go to Uncle Gaylord's\
            \ in\n   Berkeley.RPG said \u201CFine!\u201D and we drove on for a while\
            \ and talked.\n   I was drowsy, and JONL actually dropped off to sleep\
            \ for 5 minutes.  When\n   he awoke, RPG said, \u201CGee, JONL, you must\
            \ have slept all the way over\n   the bridge!\u201D, referring to the\
            \ one spanning San Francisco Bay.  Just\n   then we came to a sign that\
            \ said \u201CUniversity Avenue\u201D.  I\n   mumbled something about working\
            \ our way over to Telegraph Avenue; RPG said\n   \u201CRight!\u201D and\
            \ maneuvered some more.  Eventually we pulled up in\n   front of an Uncle\
            \ Gaylord's.Now, I hadn't really been paying attention because I was so\
            \ sleepy,\n   and I didn't really understand what was happening until\
            \ RPG let me in on it\n   a few moments later, but I was just alert enough\
            \ to notice that we had\n   somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle Gaylord's\
            \ after all.JONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store, but hadn't\n\
            \   caught on.  (The place is lit with red and yellow lights at night,\
            \ and\n   looks much different from the way it does in daylight.)  He\
            \ said,\n   \u201CThis isn't the Uncle Gaylord's I went to in Berkeley!\

            \   back in Palo Alto!\u201DRPG deadpanned, \u201CWell, this is the one\
            \ I\n   always come to when I'm in Berkeley.  They've got two in San Francisco,\n\

            \  What he didn't know was that there is a\n   completely different University\
            \ Avenue in Palo Alto.JONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger\
            \ honey.  The guy at\n   the counter asked whether JONL would like to\
            \ taste it first, evidently\n   their standard procedure with that flavor,\
            \ as not too many people like\n   it.JONL said, \u201CI'm sure I like\

        section_1: "[now primarily historical] Timesharing is the technique of scheduling\n\
            \   a computer's time so that they are shared across multiple tasks and\n\
            \   multiple users, with each user having the illusion that his or her\n\
            \   computation is going on continuously.  John McCarthy, the inventor\
            \ of\n   LISP, first imagined\n   this technique in the late 1950s.  The\
            \ first timesharing operating\n   systems, BBN's \"Little Hospital\" and\
            \ CTSS, were\n   deplayed in 1962-63.  The early hacker culture of the\
            \ 1960s and 1970s grew\n   up around the first generation of relatively\
            \ cheap timesharing computers,\n   notably the DEC 10, 11, and VAX lines.\
            \  But these\n   were only cheap in a relative sense; though quite a bit\
            \ less powerful than\n   today's personal computers, they had to be shared\
            \ by dozens or even\n   hundreds of people each.  The early hacker comunities\
            \ nucleated around\n   places where it was relatively easy to get access\
            \ to a timesharing\n   account.Nowadays, communications bandwidth is usually\
            \ the most important \n   constraint on what you can do with your computer.\
            \  Not so back then;\n   timesharing machines were often loaded to capacity,\
            \ and it was not uncommon \n   for everyone's work to grind to a halt\
            \ while the machine scheduler\n   thrashed, trying to figure out what\
            \ to do next.  Early hacker slang\n   was replete with terms like cycle\n\
            \   crunch and cycle drought\n   for describing the consequences of too\
            \ few instructions-per-second spread\n   among too many users.  As GLS\
            \ has noted, this sort of problem influenced\n   the tendency of many\
            \ hackers to work odd schedules.One reason this is worth noting here is\
            \ to make the point that the\n   earliest hacker communities were physical,\
            \ not distributed via networks;\n   they consisted of hackers who shared\
            \ a machine and therefore had to deal\n   with many of the same problems\
            \ with respect to it.  A system crash could\n   idle dozens of eager programmers,\
            \ all sitting in the same terminal room and\n   with little to do but\
            \ talk with each other until normal operation\n   resumed.Timesharing\
            \ moved from being the luxury of a few large universities\n   runing semi-experimental\
            \ operating systems to being more generally\n   available about 1975-76.\
            \ Hackers in search of more cycles and more control\n   over their programming\
            \ environment began to migrate off timesharing\n   machines and onto what\
            \ are now called workstations around 1983.  It took another ten\n   years,\
            \ the development of powerful 32-bit personal micros, the\n   Great Internet\
            \ Explosion before the migration was\n   complete.  It is no coincidence\
            \ that the last stages of this migration\n   coincided with the development\

            \   assumptions that are valid (esp. under Unix) on\n   VAXen but false\
            \ elsewhere. Among these are:\nThe assumption that dereferencing a null\
            \ pointer is safe because it is all\nbits 0, and location 0 is readable\
            \ and 0.  Problem: this may instead cause an\nillegal-address trap on\
            \ non-VAXen, and even on VAXen under OSes other than BSD\nUnix.  Usually\

            \ the pointer before using it), rather than deliberate exploitation of\
            \ a\nmisfeature.  \nThe assumption that characters are signed.  \nThe\
            \ assumption that a pointer to any one type can freely be cast into a\n\
            pointer to any other type.  A stronger form of this is the assumption\
            \ that all\npointers are the same size and format, which means you don't\
            \ have to worry\nabout getting the casts or types correct in calls.  Problem:\
            \ this fails on\nword-oriented machines or others with multiple pointer\
            \ formats.\n\nThe assumption that the parameters of a routine are stored\
            \ in memory, on a\nstack, contiguously, and in strictly ascending or descending\
            \ order.  Problem:\nthis fails on many RISC architectures.  \nThe assumption\
            \ that pointer and integer types are the same size, and that\npointers\
            \ can be stuffed into integer variables (and vice-versa) and drawn back\n\
            out without being truncated or mangled.  Problem: this fails on segmented\n\
            architectures or word-oriented machines with funny pointer formats.\n\n\
            The assumption that a data type of any size may begin at any byte address\
            \ in\nmemory (for example, that you can freely construct and dereference\
            \ a pointer\nto a word- or greater-sized object at an odd char address).\
            \  Problem: this\nfails on many (esp. RISC) architectures better optimized\
            \ for\nHLL execution speed, and can cause an illegal address\nfault or\
            \ bus error.  \nThe (related) assumption that there is no padding at the\

            \ last byte of a previous component\nto the first byte of the next one.\
            \  This is not only machine- but\ncompiler-dependent.  \nThe assumption\
            \ that memory address space is globally flat and that the array\nreference\
            \ foo[-1] is necessarily valid.\nProblem: this fails at 0, or other places\
            \ on segment-addressed machines like\nIntel chips (yes, segmentation is\
            \ universally considered a\nbrain-damaged way to design machines (see\n\
            moby), but that is a separate issue).\n\nThe assumption that objects can\
            \ be arbitrarily large with no special\nconsiderations.  Problem: this\
            \ fails on segmented architectures and under\nnon-virtual-addressing environments.\

            \ this fails\non segmented architectures or almost anything else without\
            \ virtual addressing\nand a paged stack.  \nThe assumption that bits and\
            \ addressable units within an object are ordered in\nthe same way and\
            \ that this order is a constant of nature.  Problem: this fails\non big-endian\
            \ machines.  \nThe assumption that it is meaningful to compare pointers\
            \ to different objects\nnot located within the same array, or to objects\
            \ of different types.  Problem:\nthe former fails on segmented architectures,\
            \ the latter on word-oriented\nmachines or others with multiple pointer\
            \ formats.  \nThe assumption that an int is 32 bits, or (nearly equivalently)\n\
            the assumption that sizeof(int) ==\nsizeof(long).  Problem: this fails\
            \ on PDP-11s, 286-based systems and\neven on 386 and 68000 systems under\

            crooked arrows\u2019; these could be shot through up to\n   three connected\
            \ rooms, and would kill the wumpus on a hit (later versions\n   introduced\
            \ the wounded wumpus, which got very angry).  Unfortunately for\n   players,\
