(Interestingly, the slashed zero long predates computers; Florian Cajori's   monumental A History of Mathematical Notations notes   that it was used in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.) If letter-O has   a slash across it and the zero does not, your display is tuned for a very   old convention used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers   (Scandinavians curse this arrangement even more,   because it means two of their letters collide).  Some Burroughs/Unisys   equipment displays a zero with a reversed slash. Old   CDC computers rendered letter O as an unbroken oval and 0 as an oval broken   at upper right and lower left.  And yet another convention common on early   line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the   letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O   (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how to draw ASCII   characters, but the final standard changed the distinguisher to a tick-mark   in the upper-left corner).

The standard version uses 7 bits for   each character, whereas most earlier codes (including early drafts of ASCII   prior to June 1961) used fewer.  This change allowed the inclusion of   lowercase letters \u2014 a major win \u2014 but it   did not provide for accented letters or any other letterforms not used in   English (such as the German sharp-S \ufffd. or the ae-ligature \ufffd   which is a letter in, for example, Norwegian).  It could be worse, though.   It could be much worse.  See EBCDIC to understand   how.  A history of ASCII and its ancestors is at http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html.\nComputers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than   humans; thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about   characters, and have developed a considerable amount of verbal shorthand   for them.  Every character has one or more names \u2014 some formal, some   concise, some silly.  Common jargon names for ASCII characters are   collected here.  See also individual entries for   bang, excl,   open, ques,   semi, shriek,   splat, twiddle, and   Yu-Shiang Whole Fish.\nThis list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII pronunciation   guide.  Single characters are listed in ASCII order; character pairs are   sorted in by first member.  For each character, common names are given in   rough order of popularity, followed by names that are reported but rarely   seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are surrounded by brokets: <>.   Square brackets mark the particularly silly names introduced by   INTERCAL.  The abbreviations \u201cl/r\u201d and   \u201co/c\u201d stand for left/right and \u201copen/close\u201d   respectively.  Ordinary parentheticals provide some usage   information.\nThe pronunciation of # as \u2018pound\u2019 is   common in the U.S.  but a bad idea;    Commonwealth Hackish    has its own, rather more apposite use of \u2018pound   sign\u2019 (confusingly, on British keyboards the \ufffd happens to   replace #; thus Britishers sometimes call   # on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard \u2018pound\u2019,   compounding the American error).  The U.S. usage derives from an   old-fashioned commercial practice of using a # suffix to   tag pound weights on bills of lading.  The character is usually pronounced   \u2018hash\u2019 outside the U.S.  There are more culture wars over the   correct pronunciation of this character than any other, which has led to   the ha ha only serious suggestion that it be   pronounced \u201cshibboleth\u201d (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament or   Tanakh).\nThe \u2018uparrow\u2019 name for circumflex and   \u2018leftarrow\u2019 name for underline are historical relics from   archaic ASCII (the 1963 version), which had these graphics in those   character positions rather than the modern punctuation characters.\nThe \u2018swung dash\u2019 or \u2018approximation\u2019 sign   (\u223c) is not quite the same as tilde ~ in typeset material, but the ASCII   tilde serves for both (compare angle brackets).   \nSome other common usages cause odd overlaps.  The   #, $, >, and   & characters, for example, are all pronounced   \u201chex\u201d in different communities because various assemblers use   them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in particular,   # in many assembler-programming cultures,   $ in the 6502 world, > at Texas   Instruments, and & on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and   some Z80 machines).  See also splat.\nThe inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the world's   other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more and   more like a serious misfeature as the use of   international networks continues to increase (see    software rot).   Hardware and software from the U.S. still tends to   embody the assumption that ASCII is the universal character set and that   characters have 7 bits; this is a major irritant to people who want to use   a character set suited to their own languages.  Perversely, though, efforts   to solve this problem by proliferating \u2018national\u2019 character   sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use a smaller   subset common to all those in use."

This prevented it from gaining serious   market share, despite the fact that the first Amigas had a substantial   technological lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead, it acquired a small   but zealous population of enthusiastic hackers who dreamt of one day   unseating the clones (see Amiga Persecution Complex).   The traits of this culture are both spoofed and   illuminated in  The BLAZE Humor   Viewer. The strength of the Amiga platform seeded a small industry   of companies building software and hardware for the platform, especially in   graphics and video applications (see video toaster).   \nDue to spectacular mismanagement, Commodore did hardly any R&D,   allowing the competition to close Amiga's technological lead.  After   Commodore went bankrupt in 1994 the technology passed through several   hands, none of whom did much with it.  However, the Amiga is still being   produced in Europe under license and has a substantial number of fans,   which will probably extend the platform's life considerably."

A   street address consists of an optional apartment specifier, followed by a   street number, followed by a street name.  A zip-part consists of a   town-name, followed by a comma, followed by a state code, followed by a   ZIP-code followed by an end-of-line.\u201d Note that many things (such as   the format of a personal-part, apartment specifier, or ZIP-code) are left   unspecified.

The Breidbart Index is computed as follows:   For each article in a spam, take the square-root of the number of   newsgroups to which the article is posted. The Breidbart Index is the sum   of the square roots of all of the posts in the spam. For example, one   article posted to nine newsgroups and again to sixteen would have BI =   sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) = 7.  It is generally agreed that a spam is cancelable   if the Breidbart Index exceeds 20.\nThe Breidbart Index accumulates over a 45-day window. Ten articles   yesterday and ten articles today and ten articles tomorrow add up to a   30-article spam. Spam fighters will often reset the count if you can   convince them that the spam was accidental and/or you have seen the error   of your ways and won't repeat it.

COME FROM was first   proposed in R. Lawrence Clark's A Linguistic Contribution to   GOTO-less programming, which appeared in a 1973   Datamation issue (and was reprinted in the April   1984 issue of Communications of the ACM).  This   parodied the then-raging \u2018structured programming\u2019   holy wars (see considered   harmful).  Mythically, some variants are the assigned COME FROM and the computed COME FROM (parodying some nasty   control constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of course,   multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having more than   one COME FROM statement coming from the   same label.\nIn some ways the FORTRAN DO looks   like a COME FROM statement.  After the   terminating statement number/CONTINUE is   reached, control continues at the statement following the DO.  Some   generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than CONTINUE) for the statement, leading to examples   like:\nin which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10.  (This   is particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear to have   anything to do with the flow of control at all!)  While sufficiently   astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this form of COME FROM statement isn't completely general.  After   all, control will eventually pass to the following statement.  The   implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN, ca. 1975   (though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040 ten years   earlier).  The statement AT 100 would   perform a COME FROM 100.  It was intended   strictly as a debugging aid, with dire consequences promised to anyone so   deranged as to use it in production code.  More horrible things had already   been perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only   contemplate the ALTER verb in   COBOL.  COME FROM   was supported under its own name for the first time 15 years later, in   C-INTERCAL (see INTERCAL,   retrocomputing); knowledgeable observers are still   reeling from the shock."

Generic term for a program that assists in debugging other   programs by showing individual machine instructions in a readable symbolic   form and letting the user change them.  In this sense the term DDT is now   archaic, having been widely displaced by debugger or names of individual programs like   adb, sdb,   dbx, or gdb.  \n 2. [ITS] Under MIT's fabled ITS operating   system, DDT (running under the alias HACTRN, a six-letterism for   \u2018Hack Translator\u2019) was also used as the   shell or top level command language used to execute   other programs.  \n 3. Any one of several specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early   DEC hardware and CP/M.  The PDP-10 Reference   Handbook (1969) contained a footnote on the first page of the documentation   for DDT that illuminates the origin of the term:\nHistorical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1computer in 1961.  At that time DDT stood for \u201cDEC DebuggingTape\u201d.  Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging program haspropagated throughout the computer industry.  DDT programs are nowavailable for all DEC computers.  Since media other than tape arenow frequently used, the more descriptive name \u201cDynamic DebuggingTechnique\u201d has been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation.  Confusionbetween DDT-10 and another well known pesticide,dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane C14H9Cl5should be minimal since each attacks adifferent, and apparently mutually exclusive, class of bugs.\n(The \u2018tape\u2019 referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic   but paper.)  Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the   handbook after the suits took over and   DEC became much more   \u2018businesslike\u2019.\nThe history above is known to many old-time hackers.  But there's   more: Peter Samson, compiler of the original TMRC   lexicon, reports that he named DDT   after a similar tool on the TX-0 computer, the direct ancestor of the PDP-1   built at MIT's Lincoln Lab in 1957.  The debugger on that ground-breaking   machine (the first transistorized computer) rejoiced in the name FLIT   (FLexowriter Interrogation Tape).  Flit was for many years the trade-name   of a popular insecticide."

Before the killer micro revolution of the   late 1980s, hackerdom was closely symbiotic with DEC's pioneering   timesharing machines.  The first of the group of cultures described by this   lexicon nucleated around the PDP-1 (see TMRC).   Subsequently, the PDP-6, PDP-10,   PDP-20, PDP-11 and   VAX were all foci of large and important hackerdoms,   and DEC machines long dominated the ARPANET and Internet machine   population.  DEC was the technological leader of the minicomputer era   (roughly 1967 to 1987), but its failure to embrace microcomputers and Unix   early cost it heavily in profits and prestige after   silicon got cheap.  Nevertheless, the microprocessor   design tradition owes a major debt to the PDP-11   instruction set, and every one of the major general-purpose microcomputer   OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, Windows NT) was either genetically   descended from a DEC OS, or incubated on DEC hardware, or both.

Of a person, someone whose directions are incomprehensible and   vague, but who nevertheless has the expectation that you will solve the   problem using the specific method he/she has in mind.\nWarren Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and spelling   errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and would often make   hash of anyone else's typos if they were stylistically different.  Some   victims of DWIM thus claimed that the acronym stood for \u2018Damn   Warren\u2019s Infernal Machine!'.\nIn one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the command   interpreter used at Xerox PARC.  One day another hacker there typed   delete *$ to free up some disk space.  (The   editor there named backup files by appending $ to the original file name, so he was trying to   delete any backup files left over from old editing sessions.)  It happened   that there weren't any editor backup files, so DWIM helpfully reported   *$ not found, assuming you meant 'delete   *'. It then started to delete all the files on the disk!  The   hacker managed to stop it with a Vulcan nerve pinch   after only a half dozen or so files were lost.\nThe disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go to   Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his workstation,   and then type delete *$ twice.\nDWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex   program; it is also occasionally described as the single instruction the   ideal computer would have.  Back when proofs of program correctness were in   vogue, there were also jokes about DWIMC (Do What I Mean, Correctly).

Using   + or \u2018plus\u2019 to mean addition in a computer   language is taking advantage of the ELIZA effect.\nThis term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum,   which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by re\ufffdphrasing many of the   patient's statements as questions and posing them to the patient.  It   worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution of key words into   canned phrases.  It was so convincing, however, that there are many   anecdotes about people becoming very emotionally caught up in dealing with   ELIZA.

It has since been reimplemented any number of   times, by various hackers, and versions exist that run under most major   operating systems.  Perhaps the most widely used version, also written by   Stallman and now called \u201cGNU EMACS\u201d or   GNUMACS, runs principally under Unix.

Other variants include   GOSMACS, CCA EMACS, UniPress EMACS, Montgomery   EMACS, jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS.

Other spoof expansions include   \u2018Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping\u2019 (from when that was a   lot of core), \u2018Eventually   malloc()s   All Computer Storage\u2019, and \u2018EMACS Makes A Computer Slow\u2019   (see recursive acronym).

This implicit   coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would   happen to people who stuck with IBM, but Dark Shadows loomed over the   future of competitors' equipment or software.  See   IBM.  After 1990 the term FUD was associated   increasingly frequently with Microsoft, and has   become generalized to refer to any kind of disinformation used as a   competitive weapon.\n[In 2003, SCO sued IBM in an action which, among other things,   alleged SCO's proprietary control of Linux.  The SCO   suit rapidly became infamous for the number and magnitude of falsehoods   alleged in SCO's filings.  In October 2003, SCO's lawyers filed a memorandum   in which they actually had the temerity to link to the web version of   this entry in furtherance of their claims. Whilst we   appreciate the compliment of being treated as an authority, we can return   it only by observing that SCO has become a nest of liars and thieves   compared to which IBM at its historic worst looked positively   angelic.

The intention was to   leapfrog from the old DEC timesharing system SAIL   was then running to a new generation, bypassing TENEX which at that time   was the ARPANET standard.  ARPA funding for both the Super Foonly and the   new operating system was cut in 1974.  Most of the design team went to DEC   and contributed greatly to the design of the PDP-10 model KL10.  \n 2. The name of the company formed by Dave Poole, one of the   principal Super Foonly designers, and one of hackerdom's more colorful   personalities.  Many people remember the parrot which sat on Poole's   shoulder and was a regular companion.\n 3. Any of the machines built by Poole's company.  The first was the   F-1 (a.k.a.  Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used to   create the graphics in the movie TRON.  The F-1 was   the fastest PDP-10 ever built, but only one was ever made.  The effort   drained Foonly of its financial resources, and the company turned towards   building smaller, slower, and much less expensive machines.  Unfortunately,   these ran not the popular TOPS-20 but a TENEX   variant called Foonex; this seriously limited their market.  Also, the   machines shipped were actually wire-wrapped engineering prototypes   requiring individual attention from more than usually competent site   personnel, and thus had significant reliability problems.  Poole's   legendary temper and unwillingness to suffer fools gladly did not help   matters.  By the time DEC's \u201cJupiter Project\u201d followon to the   PDP-10 was cancelled in 1983, Foonly's proposal to build another F-1 was   eclipsed by the Mars, and the company never quite   recovered.

One such strategy involves periodically scanning all the data in memory and   determining what is no longer accessible; useless data items are then   discarded so that the memory they occupy can be recycled and used for   another purpose.  Implementations of the LISP language usually use garbage   collection.\nIn jargon, the full phrase is sometimes heard but the   abbrev GC is more frequently used because it is   shorter.

Some early Unix systems at Bell Labs used GCOS   machines for print spooling and various other services; the field added to   /etc/passwd to carry GCOS ID information was called   the GECOS field and survives today as   the pw_gecos member used for the user's   full name and other human-ID information.

        "content": " MIT AI Memo 239 (February 1972).  A legendary collection of neat   mathematical and programming hacks contributed by many people at MIT and   elsewhere.  (The title of the memo really is \u201cHAKMEM\u201d, which   is a 6-letterism for \u2018hacks memo\u2019.)  Some of them are very   useful techniques, powerful theorems, or interesting unsolved problems, but   most fall into the category of mathematical and computer trivia.  Here is a   sampling of the entries (with authors), slightly paraphrased:\nItem 41 (Gene Salamin): There are exactly 23,000 prime numbers less   than   218.\nItem 46 (Rich Schroeppel): The most probable   suit distribution in bridge hands is 4-4-3-2, as compared to 4-3-3-3, which   is the most evenly distributed.  This is because the   world likes to have unequal numbers: a thermodynamic effect saying things   will not be in the state of lowest energy, but in the state of lowest   disordered energy.\nItem 81 (Rich Schroeppel): Count the magic squares of order 5 (that   is, all the 5-by-5 arrangements of the numbers from 1 to 25 such that all   rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number).  There are about   320 million, not counting those that differ only by rotation and   reflection.\nItem 154 (Bill Gosper): The myth that any given programming language   is machine independent is easily exploded by computing the sum of powers of   2.  If the result loops with period = 1   with sign +, you are on a sign-magnitude   machine.  If the result loops with period =   1 at -1, you are on a   twos-complement machine.  If the result loops with period greater than 1,   including the beginning, you are on a ones-complement machine.  If the   result loops with period greater than 1, not including the beginning, your   machine isn't binary \u2014 the pattern should tell you the base.  If you   run out of memory, you are on a string or bignum system.  If arithmetic   overflow is a fatal error, some fascist pig with a read-only mind is trying   to enforce machine independence.  But the very ability to trap overflow is   machine dependent.  By this strategy, consider the universe, or, more   precisely, algebra: Let X = the sum of   many powers of 2 = ...111111 (base 2).  Now add   X to itself: X + X   = ...111110.  Thus, 2X = X -   1, so X = -1.  Therefore   algebra is run on a machine (the universe) that is two's-complement.\nItem 174 (Bill Gosper and Stuart Nelson): 21963283741 is the only   number such that if you represent it on the PDP-10   as both an integer and a floating-point number, the bit patterns of the two   representations are identical.\nItem 176 (Gosper): The \u201cbanana phenomenon\u201d was   encountered when processing a character string by taking the last 3 letters   typed out, searching for a random occurrence of that sequence in the text,   taking the letter following that occurrence, typing it out, and iterating.   This ensures that every 4-letter string output occurs in the original.  The   program typed BANANANANANANANA.... We note an ambiguity in the   phrase, \u201cthe Nth occurrence   of.\u201d In one sense, there are five 00's in 0000000000; in another,   there are nine.  The editing program TECO finds five.  Thus it finds only   the first ANA in BANANA, and is thus obligated to type N next.  By Murphy's   Law, there is but one NAN, thus forcing A, and thus a loop.  An option to   find overlapped instances would be useful, although it would require   backing up N \u2212 1 characters before   seeking the next N-character   string.\nNote: This last item refers to a    Dissociated Press implementation.  See also    banana problem.\nHAKMEM also contains some rather more complicated mathematical and   technical items, but these examples show some of its fun flavor.\nAn HTML transcription of the entire document is available at http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/hakmem.html."

Common expansions of the corporate name   included: Inferior But Marketable; It's Better Manually; Insidious Black   Magic; It's Been Malfunctioning; Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a   near-infinite number of even less complimentary   expansions (see also fear and loathing).  What   galled hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level wasn't so much   that they were underpowered and overpriced (though that counted against   them), but that the designs were incredibly archaic,   crufty, and elephantine   ... and you couldn't fix them \u2014 source   code was locked up tight, and programming tools were expensive, hard to   find, and bletcherous to use once you had found them.\nWe didn't know how good we had it back then.

An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference Manual will   make the style of the language clear:\nIt is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose work isincomprehensible is held in high esteem.  For example, if one were to statethat the simplest way to store a value of 65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variableis:\nDO\ufffd:1\ufffd<-\ufffd#0$#256\nany sensible programmer would say that that was absurd.  Since this isindeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look foolish infront of his boss, who would of course have happened to turn up, as bosses arewont to do.  The effect would be no less devastating for the programmer havingbeen correct.\nINTERCAL has many other peculiar features designed to make it even   more unspeakable.  The Woods-Lyons implementation was actually used by many   (well, at least several) people at Princeton.  The language has been   recently reimplemented as C-INTERCAL and is consequently enjoying an   unprecedented level of unpopularity; there is even an alt.lang.intercal newsgroup devoted to the   study and ... appreciation of the language on Usenet.\nInevitably, INTERCAL has a home page on the Web: http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/.

This theorem asserts nothing about the   intelligence of the one random monkey that   eventually comes up with the script (and note that the mob will also type   out all the possible incorrect versions of Hamlet).   It may be referred to semi-seriously when justifying a brute   force method; the implication is that, with enough resources   thrown at it, any technical challenge becomes a one-banana   problem.  This argument gets more respect since   Linux justified the bazaar   mode of development.\nOther hackers maintain that the Infinite-Monkey Theorem cannot be   true \u2014 otherwise Usenet would have reproduced the entire canon of   great literature by now.\nIn mid-2002, researchers at Plymouth Univesity in England actually   put a working computer in a cage with six crested macaques.  The monkeys   proceeded to bash the machine with a rock, urinate on it, and type the   letter S a lot (later, the letters A, J, L, and M also crept in).  The   results were published in a limited-edition book, Notes Towards   The Complete Works of Shakespeare.

It became part of the idiom of techies via the classic SF short   story Inflexible   Logic by Russell Maloney, and many younger hackers know it through   a reference in Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the   Galaxy.  Some other references have been collected   on the Web.   On 1 April 2000 the usage acquired its own Internet standard,  RFC2795 (Infinite Monkey   Protocol Suite)."

        "content": " The mother of all networks.  First incarnated beginning in 1969 as   the ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense research testbed.  Though it has   been widely believed that the goal was to develop a network architecture   for military command-and-control that could survive disruptions up to and   including nuclear war, this is a myth; in fact, ARPANET was conceived from   the start as a way to get most economical use out of then-scarce   large-computer resources.  Robert Herzfeld, who was director of ARPA at    the time, has been at some pains to debunk the    \u201csurvive-a-nuclear-war\u201d myth, but it seems unkillable.\nAs originally imagined, ARPANET's major use would have been to   support what is now called remote login and more sophisticated forms of   distributed computing, but the infant technology of electronic mail quickly   grew to dominate actual usage.  Universities, research labs and defense   contractors early discovered the Internet's potential as a medium of   communication between humans and linked up in steadily   increasing numbers, connecting together a quirky mix of academics, techies,   hippies, SF fans, hackers, and anarchists.  The roots of this lexicon lie   in those early years.\nOver the next quarter-century the Internet evolved in many ways. The   typical machine/OS combination moved from DECPDP-10s and PDP-20s, running   TOPS-10 and TOPS-20, to   PDP-11s and VAXen and Suns running   Unix, and in the 1990s to Unix on Intel   microcomputers.  The Internet's protocols grew more capable, most notably   in the move from NCP/IP to TCP/IP in 1982 and the   implementation of Domain Name Service in 1983.  It was around this time   that people began referring to the collection of interconnected networks   with ARPANET at its core as \u201cthe Internet\u201d.\nThe ARPANET had a fairly strict set of participation guidelines --   connected institutions had to be involved with a DOD-related research   project.  By the mid-80s, many of the organizations clamoring to join   didn't fit this profile.  In 1986, the National Science Foundation built   NSFnet to open up access to its five regional supercomputing centers;   NSFnet became the backbone of the Internet, replacing the original ARPANET   pipes (which were formally shut down in 1990).  Between 1990 and late 1994   the pieces of NSFnet were sold to major telecommunications companies until   the Internet backbone had gone completely commercial.\nThat year, 1994, was also the year the mainstream culture discovered   the Internet.  Once again, the killer app was not   the anticipated one \u2014 rather, what caught the public imagination was   the hypertext and multimedia features of the World Wide Web.  Subsequently   the Internet has seen off its only serious challenger (the OSI protocol   stack favored by European telecoms monopolies) and is in the process of   absorbing into itself many of the proprietary networks built during the   second wave of wide-area networking after 1980.  By 1996 it had become a   commonplace even in mainstream media to predict that a globally-extended   Internet would become the key unifying communications technology of the   next century.

To play a MUD.  The   acronym MUD is often lowercased and/or verbed; thus, one may speak of   going mudding, etc.\nHistorically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with names of MU-   form) derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the   University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants of that game   still exist today and are sometimes generically called   BartleMUDs.  There is a widespread myth (repeated,   unfortunately, by earlier versions of this lexicon) that the name MUD was   trademarked to the commercial MUD run by Bartle on British Telecom (the   motto: \u201cYou haven't lived 'til you've   died on MUD!\u201d); however, this is false \u2014   Richard Bartle explicitly placed \u2018MUD\u2019 in the public domain in   1985.  BT was upset at this, as they had already printed trademark claims   on some maps and posters, which were released and created the myth.\nStudents on the European academic networks quickly improved on the   MUD concept, spawning several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD).  Many of   these had associated bulletin-board systems for social interaction.   Because these had an image as \u2018research\u2019 they often survived   administrative hostility to BBSs in general.  This, together with the fact   that Usenet feeds were often spotty and difficult to get in the U.K., made   the MUDs major foci of hackish social interaction there.\nAberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and   quickly gained popularity in the U.S.; they became nuclei for large hacker   communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom (some observers   see parallels with the growth of Usenet in the early 1980s).  The second   wave of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants) tended to emphasize social interaction,   puzzles, and cooperative world-building as opposed to combat and   competition (in writing, these social MUDs are sometimes referred to as   \u2018MU*\u2019, with \u2018MUD\u2019 implicitly reserved for the more   game-oriented ones).  By 1991, over 50% of MUD sites were of a third major   variety, LPMUD, which synthesizes the combat/puzzle aspects of AberMUD and   older systems with the extensibility of TinyMud.  In 1996 the cutting edge   of the technology is Pavel Curtis's MOO, even more extensible using a   built-in object-oriented language.  The trend toward greater   programmability and flexibility will doubtless continue.\nThe state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly, with   new simulation designs appearing (seemingly) every month.  Around 1991   there was an unsuccessful movement to deprecate the term   MUD itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding   variety of names corresponding to the different simulation styles being   explored.  It survived.  See also bonk/oif,   FOD, link-dead,   mudhead, talk mode."

Mars was the code name for a family of PDP-10-compatible computers built by   Systems Concepts (now, The SC Group): the multi-processor SC-30M, the small   uniprocessor SC-25, and the never-built superprocessor SC-40.  These   machines were marvels of engineering design; although not much slower than   the unique Foonly F-1, they were physically smaller   and consumed less power than the much slower DEC   KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4 machines.  They were also completely   compatible with the DEC KL10, and ran all KL10 binaries (including the   operating system) with no modifications at about 2--3 times faster than a   KL10.\nWhen DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983 (their followup to the   PDP-10), Systems Concepts should have made a bundle selling their machine   into shops with a lot of software investment in PDP-10s, and in fact their   spring 1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the PDP-10   world.  TOPS-10 was running on the Mars by the summer of 1984, and TOPS-20   by early fall.  Unfortunately, the hackers running Systems Concepts were   much better at designing machines than at mass producing or selling them;   the company allowed itself to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism   into continually improving the design, and lost credibility as delivery   dates continued to slip.  They also overpriced the product ridiculously;   they believed they were competing with the KL10 and   VAX 8600 and failed to reckon with the likes of Sun   Microsystems and other hungry startups building workstations with power   comparable to the KL10 at a fraction of the price.  By the time SC shipped   the first SC-30M to Stanford in late 1985, most customers had already made   the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP-10, usually for VMS or Unix   boxes.  Most of the Mars computers built ended up being purchased by   CompuServe.\nThis tale and the related saga of Foonly hold   a lesson for hackers: if you want to play in the    Real World, you need to learn Real World moves."

Further   variants were spawned by Intel's PR department and various   journalists.\nIt has been shown   that none of the variants of Moore's Law actually fit the data very well   (the price curves within DRAM generations perhaps come closest).   Nevertheless, Moore's Law is constantly invoked to set up expectations   about the next generation of computing technology.  See also   Parkinson's Law of Data and Gates's   Law."

The design was first presented in 1965,   planned for operation in 1967, first operational in 1969, and took several   more years to achieve respectable performance and stability.\nMultics was very innovative for its time \u2014 among other things,   it provided a hierarchical file system with access control on individual   files and introduced the idea of treating all devices uniformly as special   files.  It was also the first OS to run on a symmetric multiprocessor, and   the only general-purpose system to be awarded a B2 security rating by the   NSA (see Orange Book).\nBell Labs left the development effort in 1969 after judging that   second-system effect had bloated Multics to the   point of practical unusability.  Honeywell commercialized Multics in 1972   after buying out GE's computer group, but it was never very successful: at   its peak in the 1980s, there were between 75 and 100 Multics sites, each a   multi-million dollar mainframe.\nOne of the former Multics developers from Bell Labs was Ken Thompson,   and Unix deliberately carried through and extended   many of Multics' design ideas; indeed, Thompson described the very name   \u2018Unix\u2019 as \u201ca weak pun on Multics\u201d.  For this and   other reasons, aspects of the Multics design remain a topic of occasional   debate among hackers.  See also brain-damaged and   GCOS.\nMIT ended its development association with Multics in 1977.   Honeywell sold its computer business to Bull in the mid 80s, and   development on Multics was stopped in 1988.  Four Multics sites were known   to be still in use as late as 1998, but the last one (a Canadian military   site) was decommissioned in November 2000.

For example, you don't make a two-pin plug   symmetrical and then label it \u201cTHIS WAY UP\u201d; if it matters   which way it is plugged in, then you make the design asymmetrical (see also   the anecdote under magic smoke).\nEdward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of McDonnell-Douglas's test   engineers on the rocket-sled experiments that were done by the U.S. Air   Force in 1949 to test human acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981).   One experiment involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different   parts of the subject's body.  There were two ways each sensor could be   glued to its mount, and somebody methodically installed all 16 in a   replacement set the wrong way around.  Murphy then made the original form   of his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John Paul Stapp)   mis-quoted (apparently in the more general form \u201cWhatever can go   wrong, will go wrong)\u201d at a news conference a   few days later.\nWithin months \u2018Murphy's Law\u2019 had spread to various   technical cultures connected to aerospace engineering.  Before too many   years had gone by variants had passed into the popular imagination,   changing as they went.  Most of these are variants on \u201cAnything that   can go wrong, will\u201d; this is more correctly referred to as   Finagle's Law.  The memetic drift apparent in these   mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!"

Then another machine tries to reach   either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself becomes   pseudo-down.  The first machine to discover the down one is now trying both   to access the down one and to respond to the pseudo-down one, so it is even   harder to reach.  This situation snowballs very quickly, and soon the   entire network of machines is frozen \u2014 worst of all, the user can't   even abort the file access that started the problem!

The 10 was eventually   eclipsed by the VAX machines (descendants of the   PDP-11) when DEC recognized   that the 10 and VAX product lines were competing   with each other and decided to concentrate its software development effort   on the more profitable VAX.

This language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting themselves   in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a   general-purpose-programming point of view, was later promoted as a   general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family of   languages including Modula-2 and Ada (see also   bondage-and-discipline language).  The hackish point   of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating (and, in its   deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper by Brian Kernighan (of   K&R fame) entitled   Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language,   which was turned down by the technical journals but circulated widely via   photocopies.  It was eventually published in Comparing and   Assessing Programming Languages, edited by Alan Feuer and   Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984).  Part of his discussion is worth   repeating here, because its criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself   after many years of improvement and could also stand as an indictment of   many other bondage-and-discipline languages.  (The entire essay is   available at http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html.)   At the end of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:\n9. There is no escape\nThis last point is perhaps the most important.  The language isinadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape itslimitations.  There are no casts to disable the type-checking when necessary.There is no way to replace the defective run-time environment with a sensibleone, unless one controls the compiler that defines the \u201cstandardprocedures\u201d.  The language is closed.\nPeople who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal trap.Because the language is impotent, it must be extended.  But each group extendsPascal in its own direction, to make it look like whatever language theyreally want.  Extensions for separate compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, stringdata types, internal static variables, initialization, octal numbers, bitoperators, etc., all add to the utility of the language for one group butdestroy its portability to others.\nI feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond itsoriginal target.  In its pure form, Pascal is a toy language, suitable forteaching but not for real programming.\nPascal has since been entirely displaced (mainly by   C) from the niches it had acquired in serious   applications and systems programming, and from its role as a teaching   language by Java."

Though the   policy does tend to accommodate broken implementations it is held   to more important to get the communication flowing than to   immediately (but terminally) diagnose the broken implementations   at the expense of the people trying to use them.\nThe principle is a well-known one in the design of programs   that handle Internet wire protocols, especially network   relays and servers, and it is regularly applied by extension   in any situation where two or more separately-implemented   pieces of software are supposed to interoperate even though the   various implementors have never talked to each other and have   absolutely nothing whatsoever in common other than having   all read the same protocol specification.  The principle travels   under several different names, including \u201cthe Internet credo\u201d,   \u201cthe IETF maxim\u201d, \u201cthe Internet Engineering   Principle\u201d, and   \u201cthe liberal/conservative rule\u201d; the [proposed] term   \u201cPostel' Prescription\u201d is a tribute to its inventor, the first   RFC editor   and (until his untimely death) probably the single most respected   individual in the Internet engineering community."

Perhaps the single most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet   mail-format standard).  The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by   technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by the   Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an institution   such as ANSI.  For this reason, they remain known as RFCs even once adopted   as standards.\nThe RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact   standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has important   advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process typical of ANSI   or ISO.  Emblematic of some of these advantages is the existence of a   flourishing tradition of \u2018joke\u2019 RFCs; usually at least one a   year is published, usually on April 1st.  Well-known joke RFCs have   included 527 (\u201cARPAWOCKY\u201d, R. Merryman, UCSD; 22 June 1973),   748 (\u201cTelnet Randomly-Lose Option\u201d, Mark R.

The first was   a Lewis Carroll pastiche; the second a parody of the TCP-IP documentation   style, and the third a deadpan skewering of standards-document legalese,   describing protocols for transmitting Internet data packets by carrier   pigeon (since actually implemented; see Appendix A).  See also   Infinite-Monkey Theorem.\nThe RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work \u2014 they   frequently manage to have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in   informal specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that   often haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has grown to   truly worldwide proportions."

The existence of these standards documents   (and the technically inappropriate but politically mandated compromises   that they inevitably contain, and the impenetrable   legalese in which they are invariably written, and   the unbelievably tedious bureaucratic process by which they are produced)   can be unnerving to hackers, who are used to a certain amount of ambiguity   in the specifications of the systems they use.  (Hackers feel that such   ambiguities are acceptable as long as the Right   Thing to do is obvious to any thinking observer; sadly, this   casual attitude towards specifications becomes unworkable when a system   becomes popular in the Real World.)  Since a hacker   is likely to feel that a standards document is both unnecessary and   technically deficient, the deprecation inherent in this term may be   directed as much against the standard as against the person who ought to   read it."

Early releases of   Solaris (that is, Solaris 2, as some marketroids at   Sun retroactively rechristened SunOS as Solaris 1) were quite buggy, and   Sun was forced by customer demand to support SunOS for quite some   time. Newer versions are acknowledged to be among the best commercial Unix   variants in 1998, but still lose single-processor benchmarks to Sparc   Linux. Compare HP-SUX,   sun-stools."

A text editor developed at MIT and modified by   just about everybody.  With all the dialects included, TECO may have been   the most prolific editor in use before EMACS, to   which it was directly ancestral.  Noted for its powerful   programming-language-like features and its unspeakably   hairy syntax.  It is literally the case that every   string of characters is a valid TECO program (though probably not a useful   one); one common game used to be mentally working out what the TECO   commands corresponding to human names did.  \n 2. vt. Originally, to edit using   the TECO editor in one of its infinite variations (see below).\n 3. vt.,obs.  To edit even when TECO is not the   editor being used!  This usage is rare and now primarily historical.\nAs an example of TECO's obscurity, here is a TECO program that takes   a list of names such as:\nLoser,\ufffdJ.\ufffdRandomQuux,\ufffdThe\ufffdGreatDick,\ufffdMoby\nsorts them alphabetically according to surname, and then puts the   surname last, removing the comma, to produce the following:\nMoby\ufffdDickJ.\ufffdRandom\ufffdLoserThe\ufffdGreat\ufffdQuux\nThe program is\n[1\ufffdJ^P$L$$J\ufffd<.-Z;\ufffd.,(S,$\ufffd-D\ufffd.)FX1\ufffd@F^B\ufffd$K\ufffd:L\ufffdI\ufffd$\ufffdG1\ufffdL>$$\n(where ^B means \u2018Control-B\u2019 (ASCII 0000010) and $ is   actually an alt or escape (ASCII 0011011)   character).\nIn fact, this very program was used to produce the second, sorted   list from the first list.  The first hack at it had a   bug: GLS (the author) had accidentally omitted the   @ in front of F^B, which as anyone can see is clearly the   Wrong Thing.  It worked fine the second time.  There   is no space to describe all the features of TECO, but it may be of interest   that ^P means \u2018sort\u2019 and   J<.-Z; ... L> is an idiomatic   series of commands for \u2018do once for every line\u2019.\nIn mid-1991, TECO is pretty much one with the dust of history, having   been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by   EMACS.  Descendants of an early (and somewhat   lobotomized) version adopted by DEC can still be found lurking on VMS and a   couple of crufty PDP-11 operating systems, however, and ports of the more   advanced MIT versions remain the focus of some antiquarian interest.

The control system   alone featured about 1200 relays.  There were scram   switches located at numerous places around the room that could   be thwacked if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train   going full-bore at an obstruction.  Another feature of the system was a   digital clock on the dispatch board, which was itself something of a wonder   in those bygone days before cheap LEDs and seven-segment displays.  When   someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced   with the word \u2018FOO\u2019; at TMRC the scram switches are therefore   called foo switches.\nSteven Levy, in his book Hackers (see the   Bibliography in Appendix C), gives a   stimulating account of those early years.

TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt, Beranek & Newman's TENEX operating   system using special paging hardware.  By the early 1970s, almost all of   the systems on the ARPANET ran TENEX.  DEC purchased the rights to TENEX   from BBN and began work to make it their own.  The first in-house code name   for the operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System); when   customers started asking questions, the name was changed to SNARK so DEC   could truthfully deny that there was any project called VIROS.  When the   name SNARK became known, the name was briefly reversed to become KRANS;   this was quickly abandoned when someone objected that krans meant \u2018funeral wreath\u2019 in   Swedish (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply   \u2018wreath\u2019; this part of the story may be apocryphal).   Ultimately DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it   was as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The hacker community, mindful of its   origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of \u2018twenty   TENEX\u2019), even though by this point very little of the original TENEX   code remained (analogously to the differences between AT&T V6 Unix and   BSD).  DEC people cringed when they heard \u201cTWENEX\u201d, but the   term caught on nevertheless (the written abbreviation \u201820x\u2019 was   also used).  TWENEX was successful and very popular; in fact, there was a   period in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of   partisans as Unix or ITS \u2014 but DEC's decision to scrap all the   internal rivals to the VAX architecture and its   relatively stodgy VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's   brief day in the sun.  DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20 users to convert   to VMS, but instead, by the late 1980s, most of the   TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix.  There is a TOPS-20 home page."

The language was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of   The Art of Computer Programming is not expected to   appear until 2007.

Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a   co-author of the system.  The turning point in Unix's history came when it   was reimplemented almost entirely in C during 1972\u20141974, making it   the first source-portable OS.  Unix subsequently underwent mutations and   expansions at the hands of many different people, resulting in a uniquely   flexible and developer-friendly environment.  By 1991, Unix had become the   most widely used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world   \u2014 and since 1996 the variant called Linux has   been at the cutting edge of the open source   movement.

Dennis Ritchie says that the \u2018UNIX\u2019 spelling   originally happened in CACM's 1974 paper The UNIX Time-Sharing   System because \u201cwe had a new typesetter and   troff had just been invented and we were intoxicated   by being able to produce small caps.\u201d Later, dmr tried to get the   spelling changed to \u2018Unix\u2019 in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on   the grounds that the word is not acronymic.  He failed, and eventually (his   words) \u201cwimped out\u201d on the issue.

This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating system that is   apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also relatively unreliable   and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from AT&T).  This   theory was lent a substantial impetus in 1984 by the paper referenced in   the back door entry.\nIn this view, Unix was designed to be one of the first computer   viruses (see virus) \u2014 but a virus spread to   computers indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly   through disks and networks.  Adherents of this \u2018Unix virus\u2019   theory like to cite the fact that the well-known quotation \u201cUnix is   snake oil\u201d was uttered by DEC president   Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC began actively promoting its own family of   Unix workstations.

Avoidable   by use of allocation strategies that never alias allocated core, or by use   of higher-level languages, such as LISP, which   employ a garbage collector (see GC).

Syn.     trap door; may also be called a wormhole.  See also    iron box, cracker,   worm, logic bomb.\nHistorically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than   anyone expected or planned, and a few have become widely known.  Ken   Thompson's 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the existence of a   back door in early Unix versions that may have qualified as the most   fiendishly clever security hack of all time.  In this scheme, the C   compiler contained code that would recognize when the login command was being recompiled and insert   some code recognizing a password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to   the system whether or not an account had been created for him.\nNormally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the   source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler.  But to   recompile the compiler, you have to use the compiler   \u2014 so Thompson also arranged that the compiler would   recognize when it was compiling a version of itself,   and insert into the recompiled compiler the code to insert into the   recompiled login the code to allow   Thompson entry \u2014 and, of course, the code to recognize itself and do   the whole thing again the next time around!  And having done this once, he   was then able to recompile the compiler from the original sources; the hack   perpetuated itself invisibly, leaving the back door in place and active but   with no trace in the sources.\nThe Turing lecture that reported this truly moby hack was later   published as \u201cReflections on Trusting Trust\u201d,   Communications of the ACM 27, 8 (August 1984),   pp. 761--763 (text available at http://www.acm.org/classics/).   Ken Thompson has since confirmed that this hack was implemented and that   the Trojan Horse code did appear in the login binary of a Unix Support   group machine.  Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed.  Your   editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the crocked login   did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled at least   one late-night login across the network by someone using the login name   \u201ckt\u201d."

This term   derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints, first   used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry.  Alpha Test was the unit, module, or component   test phase; Beta Test was initial   system test.  These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for   hardware.  The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation   done before any commitment to design and development.  The B-test was a   demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified.  The   C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early   samples of the production design, and the D test was the C test repeated   after the model had been in production a while."

Any imbalance results in bits   filling up the bit bucket.

        "content": " (alt.: bit-shift keyboard) A   non-standard keyboard layout that seems to have originated with the   Teletype ASR-33 and remained common for several years on early computer   equipment.  The ASR-33 was a mechanical device (see   EOU), so the only way to generate the character   codes from keystrokes was by some physical linkage.  The design of the   ASR-33 assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be modified   by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed.  In order to   avoid making the thing even more of a kluge than it already was, the design   had to group characters that shared the same basic bit pattern on one   key.\nLooking at the ASCII chart, we find:\nThis is why the characters !\"#$%&'() appear where they do on a   Teletype (thankfully, they didn't use shift-0 for space). The Teletype   Model 33 was actually designed before ASCII existed, and was originally   intended to use a code that contained these two rows:\nThe result would have been something closer to a normal keyboard.   But as it happened, Teletype had to use a lot of persuasion just to keep   ASCII, and the Model 33 keyboard, from looking like this instead:\nTeletype's was not the weirdest variant of the   QWERTY layout widely seen, by the way; that prize   should probably go to one of several (differing) arrangements on IBM's even   clunkier 026 and 029 card punches.\nWhen electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there   was no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be laid out.   Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard, while others used the   flexibility of electronic circuitry to make their product look like an   office typewriter.  Either choice was supported by the ANSI computer   keyboard standard, X4.14-1971, which referred to the alternatives as   \u201clogical bit pairing\u201d and \u201ctypewriter   pairing\u201d. These alternatives became known as bit-paired and typewriter-paired keyboards.  To a hacker, the   bit-paired keyboard seemed far more logical \u2014 and because most   hackers in those days had never learned to touch-type, there was little   pressure from the pioneering users to adapt keyboards to the typewriter   standard.\nThe doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale introduction   of the computer terminal into the normal office environment, where   out-and-out technophobes were expected to use the equipment.  The typewriter-paired standard became universal,   X4.14 was superseded by X4.23-1982, bit-paired hardware was quickly junked or   relegated to dusty corners, and both terms passed into disuse.\nHowever, in countries without a long history of touch typing, the   argument against the bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or nonexistent. As   a result, the standard Japanese keyboard, used on PCs, Unix boxen   etc. still has all of the !\"#$%&'() characters above the numbers in the   ASR-33 layout."

One version ran in its entirety as   follows:\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdACHTUNG!\ufffd\ufffdALLES\ufffdLOOKENSPEEPERS!Alles\ufffdtouristen\ufffdund\ufffdnon-technischen\ufffdlooken\ufffdpeepers!Das\ufffdcomputermachine\ufffdist\ufffdnicht\ufffdfuer\ufffdgefingerpoken\ufffdund\ufffdmittengrabben.Ist\ufffdeasy\ufffdschnappen\ufffdder\ufffdspringenwerk,\ufffdblowenfusen\ufffdund\ufffdpoppencorkenmit\ufffdspitzensparken.\ufffd\ufffdIst\ufffdnicht\ufffdfuer\ufffdgewerken\ufffdbei\ufffddas\ufffddumpkopfen.Das\ufffdrubbernecken\ufffdsichtseeren\ufffdkeepen\ufffddas\ufffdcotten-pickenen\ufffdhans\ufffdin\ufffddaspockets\ufffdmuss;\ufffdrelaxen\ufffdund\ufffdwatchen\ufffddas\ufffdblinkenlichten.\nThis silliness dates back at least as far as 1955 at IBM   and had already gone international by the early 1960s, when it   was reported at London University's ATLAS computing site.  There are   several variants of it in circulation, some of which actually do end with   the word \u2018blinkenlights\u2019.\nIn an amusing example of turnabout-is-fair-play, German hackers have   developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster in fractured   English, one of which is reproduced here:\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdATTENTIONThis\ufffdroom\ufffdis\ufffdfullfilled\ufffdmit\ufffdspecial\ufffdelectronische\ufffdequippment.Fingergrabbing\ufffdand\ufffdpressing\ufffdthe\ufffdcnoeppkes\ufffdfrom\ufffdthe\ufffdcomputers\ufffdisallowed\ufffdfor\ufffddie\ufffdexperts\ufffdonly!\ufffd\ufffdSo\ufffdall\ufffdthe\ufffd\u201clefthanders\u201d\ufffdstay\ufffdawayand\ufffddo\ufffdnot\ufffddisturben\ufffdthe\ufffdbrainstorming\ufffdvon\ufffdhere\ufffdworkingintelligencies.\ufffd\ufffdOtherwise\ufffdyou\ufffdwill\ufffdbe\ufffdout\ufffdthrown\ufffdand\ufffdkickedanderswhere!\ufffd\ufffdAlso:\ufffdplease\ufffdkeep\ufffdstill\ufffdand\ufffdonly\ufffdwatchen\ufffdastaunishedthe\ufffdblinkenlights.\nSee also geef.\nOld-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for blinkenlights because   they were so much more fun to look at than a blank panel.  Sadly, very few   computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard certainly don't   count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost of front-panel cutouts,   almost nobody needs or wants to interpret machine-register states on the   fly anymore) are only part of the story.  Another part of it is that   radio-frequency leakage from the lamp wiring was beginning to be a problem   as far back as transistor machines.  But the most fundamental fact is that   there are very few signals slow enough to blink an LED these days!  With   slow CPUs, you could watch the bus register or instruction counter tick,   but even at 33/66/150MHz (let alone gigahertz speeds) it's all a   blur.\nDespite this, a couple of relatively recent computer designs of note   have featured programmable blinkenlights that were added just because they   looked cool.  The Connection Machine, a 65,536-processor parallel computer   designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a   grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving   life patterns.  A few years later the ill-fated   BeBox (a personal computer designed to run the BeOS operating system)   featured twin rows of blinkenlights on the case front. When Be,   Inc. decided to get out of the hardware business in 1996 and instead ported   their OS to the PowerPC and later to the Intel architecture, many users   suffered severely from the absence of their beloved blinkenlights.  Before   long an external version of the blinkenlights driven by a PC serial port   became available; there is some sort of plot symmetry in the fact that it   was assembled by a German.\nFinally, a version updated for the Internet has been seen on   news.admin.net-abuse.email:\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdACHTUNG!\ufffdALLES\ufffdLOOKENSPEEPERS!Das\ufffdInternet\ufffdis\ufffdnicht\ufffdfuer\ufffdgefingerclicken\ufffdund\ufffdgiffengrabben.\ufffdIst\ufffdeasydroppenpacket\ufffdder\ufffdrouters\ufffdund\ufffdoverloaden\ufffdder\ufffdbackbone\ufffdmit\ufffdder\ufffdspammenund\ufffdder\ufffdme-tooen.\ufffd\ufffdIst\ufffdnicht\ufffdfuer\ufffdgewerken\ufffdbei\ufffddas\ufffddumpkopfen.\ufffdDasmausklicken\ufffdsichtseeren\ufffdkeepen\ufffddas\ufffdbandwit-spewin\ufffdhans\ufffdin\ufffddas\ufffdpocketsmuss;\ufffdrelaxen\ufffdund\ufffdwatchen\ufffddas\ufffdcursorblinken.\nThis newest version partly reflects reports that the word   \u2018blinkenlights\u2019 is (in 1999) undergoing something of a revival   in usage, but applied to networking equipment. The transmit and receive   lights on routers, activity lights on switches and hubs, and other network   equipment often blink in visually pleasing and seemingly coordinated   ways. Although this is different in some ways from register readings, a   tall stack of Cisco equipment or a 19-inch rack of ISDN terminals can   provoke a similar feeling of hypnotic awe, especially in a darkened network   operations center or server room.\nThe ancestor of the original blinkenlights posters of the 1950s was   probably this:\nWWII-era machine-shop poster\nWe are informed that cod-German parodies of this kind were very    common in Allied machine shops during and following WWII.  Germans,   then as now, had a reputation for being both good with precision   machinery and prone to officious notices."

This is sometimes used of human thought   processes, as in the following exchange: \u201cYou've lost me.\u201d   \u201cOK, reboot.  Here's the theory....\u201d\nThis term is also found in the variants cold boot (from power-off condition) and   warm boot (with the CPU and all   devices already powered up, as after a hardware reset or software   crash).\nAnother variant: soft boot,   reinitialization of only part of a system, under control of other software   still running: \u201cIf you're running the mess-dos   emulator, control-alt-insert will cause a soft-boot of the emulator, while   leaving the rest of the system running.\u201d\nOpposed to this there is hard   boot, which connotes hostility towards or frustration with the   machine being booted: \u201cI'll have to hard-boot this losing   Sun.\u201d \u201cI recommend booting it hard.\u201d One often   hard-boots by performing a power cycle.\nHistorical note: this term derives from bootstrap loader, a short program that was read   in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in from the front panel switches.   This program was always very short (great efforts were expended on making   it short in order to minimize the labor and chance of error involved in   toggling it in), but was just smart enough to read in a slightly more   complex program (usually from a card or paper tape reader), to which it   handed control; this program in turn was smart enough to read the   application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk drive.   Thus, in successive steps, the computer \u2018pulled itself up by its   bootstraps\u2019 to a useful operating state.  Nowadays the bootstrap is   usually found in ROM or EPROM, and reads the first stage in from a fixed   location on the disk, called the \u2018boot block\u2019.  When this   program gains control, it is powerful enough to load the actual OS and hand   control over to it."

The term can also be used in reference to programming style: brute-force   programs are written in a heavyhanded, tedious way, full of repetition and   devoid of any elegance or useful abstraction (see also    brute force and ignorance).\nThe canonical example of a brute-force   algorithm is associated with the \u2018traveling salesman problem\u2019   (TSP), a classical NP-hard problem: Suppose a person   is in, say, Boston, and wishes to drive to N other   cities.  In what order should the cities be visited in order to minimize   the distance travelled?  The brute-force method is to simply generate all   possible routes and compare the distances; while guaranteed to work and   simple to implement, this algorithm is clearly very stupid in that it   considers even obviously absurd routes (like going from Boston to Houston   via San Francisco and New York, in that order).  For very small   N it works well, but it rapidly becomes absurdly   inefficient when N increases (for N =   15, there are already 1,307,674,368,000 possible routes to   consider, and for N = 1000 \u2014 well, see   bignum).  Sometimes, unfortunately, there is no   better general solution than brute force.  See also   NP- and rubber-hose   cryptanalysis.\nA more simple-minded example of brute-force programming is finding   the smallest number in a large list by first using an existing program to   sort the list in ascending order, and then picking the first number off the   front.\nWhether brute-force programming should actually be considered stupid   or not depends on the context; if the problem is not terribly big, the   extra CPU time spent on a brute-force solution may cost less than the   programmer time it would take to develop a more \u2018intelligent\u2019   algorithm.  Additionally, a more intelligent algorithm may imply more   long-term complexity cost and bug-chasing than are justified by the speed   improvement.\nKen Thompson, co-inventor of Unix, is reported to have uttered the   epigram \u201cWhen in doubt, use brute force\u201d.  He probably   intended this as a ha ha only serious, but the   original Unix kernel's preference for simple, robust, and portable   algorithms over brittle \u2018smart\u2019 ones   does seem to have been a significant factor in the success of that OS.   Like so many other tradeoffs in software design, the choice between brute   force and complex, finely-tuned cleverness is often a difficult one that   requires both engineering savvy and delicate esthetic judgment."

Because it is   not very good relative to other methods and is the one typically stumbled   on by naive and untutored programmers, hackers   consider it the canonical example of a naive   algorithm.

For many years the logbook associated with the incident and the   actual bug in question (a moth) sat in a display case at the Naval Surface   Warfare Center (NSWC).  The entire story, with a picture of the logbook and   the moth taped into it, is recorded in the Annals of the History   of Computing, Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981), pp. 285--286.\nThe text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads \u201c1545   Relay #70 Panel F (moth) in relay.  First actual case of bug being   found\u201d.  This wording establishes that the term was already in use   at the time in its current specific sense \u2014 and Hopper herself   reports that the term bug was   regularly applied to problems in radar electronics during WWII.\nThe \u2018original bug\u2019 (the caption date is incorrect)\nIndeed, the use of bug to mean   an industrial defect was already established in Thomas Edison's time, and a   more specific and rather modern use can be found in an electrical handbook   from 1896 (Hawkin's New Catechism of Electricity,   Theo. Audel & Co.)  which says: \u201cThe term \u2018bug\u2019 is   used to a limited extent to designate any fault or trouble in the   connections or working of electric apparatus.\u201d It further notes that   the term is \u201csaid to have originated in quadruplex telegraphy and   have been transferred to all electric apparatus.\u201d\nThe latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the   term; that it came from telephone company usage, in which \u201cbugs in a   telephone cable\u201d were blamed for noisy lines.  Though this   derivation seems to be mistaken, it may well be a distorted memory of a   joke first current among telegraph operators more than   a century ago!\nOr perhaps not a joke.  Historians of the field inform us that the   term \u201cbug\u201d was regularly used in the early days of telegraphy   to refer to a variety of semi-automatic telegraphy keyers that would send a   string of dots if you held them down.  In fact, the Vibroplex keyers (which   were among the most common of this type) even had a graphic of a beetle on   them (and still do)!  While the ability to send repeated dots automatically   was very useful for professional morse code operators, these were also   significantly trickier to use than the older manual keyers, and it could   take some practice to ensure one didn't introduce extraneous dots into the   code by holding the key down a fraction too long.  In the hands of an   inexperienced operator, a Vibroplex \u201cbug\u201d on the line could   mean that a lot of garbled Morse would soon be coming your way.\nFurther, the term \u201cbug\u201d has long been used among radio   technicians to describe a device that converts electromagnetic field   variations into acoustic signals.  It is used to trace radio interference   and look for dangerous radio emissions.  Radio community usage derives from   the roach-like shape of the first versions used by 19th century physicists.   The first versions consisted of a coil of wire (roach body), with the two   wire ends sticking out and bent back to nearly touch forming a spark gap   (roach antennae).  The bug is to the radio technician what the stethoscope   is to the stereotypical medical doctor.  This sense is almost certainly   ancestral to modern use of \u201cbug\u201d for a covert monitoring   device, but may also have contributed to the use of \u201cbug\u201d for   the effects of radio interference itself.\nActually, use of bug in the   general sense of a disruptive event goes back to Shakespeare!  (Henry VI,   part III - Act V, Scene II: King Edward: \u201cSo, lie thou there. Die   thou; and die our fear; For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.\u201d)   In the first edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary one meaning of   bug is \u201cA frightful object; a   walking spectre\u201d; this is traced to \u2018bugbear\u2019, a Welsh   term for a variety of mythological monster which (to complete the circle)   has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon through fantasy   role-playing games.\nIn any case, in jargon the word almost never refers to insects.  Here   is a plausible conversation that never actually happened: \u201cThere is a   bug in this ant farm!\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?  I don't see any   ants in it.\u201d \u201cThat's the bug.\u201d\nA careful discussion of the etymological issues can be found in a   paper by Fred R. Shapiro, 1987, \u201cEntomology of the Computer Bug:   History and Folklore\u201d, American Speech 62(4):376-378.\n[There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved to   the Smithsonian, and an earlier version of this entry so asserted.  A   correspondent who thought to check discovered that the bug was not there.   While investigating this in late 1990, your editor discovered that the NSWC   still had the bug, but had unsuccessfully tried to get the Smithsonian to   accept it \u2014 and that the present curator of their History of American   Technology Museum didn't know this and agreed that it would make a   worthwhile exhibit.  It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid-1991, but due   to space and money constraints was not actually exhibited for years   afterwards.  Thus, the process of investigating the original-computer-bug   bug fixed it in an entirely unexpected way, by making the myth true!   \u2014ESR]\nIt helps to remember that this dates from 1973.\n(The next cartoon in the Crunchly saga is\t73-10-31.

This word   has a somewhat more technical meaning in mathematics.  Two formulas such as   9 + x and x +   9 are said to be equivalent because they mean the same   thing, but the second one is in canonical   form because it is written in the usual way, with the highest   power of x first.  Usually there are fixed   rules you can use to decide whether something is in canonical form.  The   jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning, acquired its present   loading in computer-science culture largely through its prominence in   Alonzo Church's work in computation theory and mathematical logic (see   Knights of the Lambda Calculus).  Compare   vanilla.\nNon-technical academics do not use the adjective   \u2018canonical\u2019 in any of the senses defined above with any   regularity; they do however use the nouns canon and canonicity (not **canonicalness or   **canonicality). The canon of a given   author is the complete body of authentic works by that author (this usage   is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as well as to literary scholars).   \u2018The canon\u2019 is the body of works in a   given field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of music) deemed   worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to investigate.\nThe word \u2018canon\u2019 has an interesting history.  It derives   ultimately from the Greek   \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (akin to the   English \u2018cane\u2019) referring to a reed.  Reeds were used for   measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word \u2018canon\u2019   meant a rule or a standard.  The establishment of a canon of scriptures   within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a rule for the   religion.  The above non-techspeak academic usages stem from this instance   of a defined and accepted body of work.  Alongside this usage was the   promulgation of \u2018canons\u2019 (\u2018rules\u2019) for the   government of the Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages (\u201caccording   to religious law\u201d) derive from this use of the Latin   \u2018canon\u2019.\nHackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic   contrast with its historical meaning.  A true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new   at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the incessant use of jargon.   Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS made a point of using as much of it   as possible in his presence, and eventually it began to sink in.  Finally,   in one conversation, he used the word canonical in jargon-like fashion without   thinking.  Steele: \u201cAha!  We've finally got you talking jargon   too!\u201d Stallman: \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Steele: \u201cBob   just used \u2018canonical\u2019 in the canonical way.\u201d\nOf course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly   defined as the way hackers normally expect things to   be.  Thus, a hacker may claim with a straight face that \u2018according to   religious law\u2019 is not the canonical meaning of   canonical."

The confetti-like paper bits punched out of cards or paper tape;   this has also been called chaff,   computer confetti, and keypunch droppings.  It's reported that this   was very old Army slang (associated with teletypewriters before the   computer era), and has been occasionally sighted in directions for   punched-card vote tabulators long after it passed out of live use among   computer programmers in the late 1970s.  This sense of \u2018chad\u2019   returned to the mainstream during the finale of the hotly disputed   U.S. presidential election in 2000 via stories about the Florida vote   recounts.  Note however that in the revived mainstream usage chad is not a   mass noun and \u2018a chad\u2019 is a single piece of the stuff.\nThere is an urban legend that chad (sense 2) derives from the Chadless   keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little u-shaped tabs in the   card to make a hole when the tab folded back, rather than punching out a   circle/rectangle; it was clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make   them, then the stuff that other keypunches made had to be   \u2018chad\u2019.  However, serious attempts to track down   \u201cChadless\u201d as a personal name or U.S. trademark have failed,   casting doubt on this etymology \u2014 and the U.S. Patent Classification   System uses \u201cchadless\u201d (small c) as an adjective, suggesting   that \u201cchadless\u201d derives from \u201cchad\u201d and not the   other way around.  There is another legend that the word was originally   acronymic, standing for \u201cCard Hole Aggregate Debris\u201d, but this   has all the earmarks of a backronym.  It has also   been noted that the word \u201cchad\u201d is Scots dialect for gravel,   but nobody has proposed any plausible reason that card chaff should be   thought of as gravel.  None of these etymologies is really   plausible.\nThis is one way to be       chadless.\n(The next cartoon in the Crunchly saga is       75-10-04.  The previous\tcartoon was 74-12-29.)"

This can happen when the drive has   been subjected to a physical shock, or when the disk is exposed to an   electromagnetic field, such as that of the CRT.  Another common cause   is when a package of disks is armed with an anti-theft strip   at a store. When the clerk scans the product to disarm the strip, it can   demagnetize the disks, wiping out track 0.\nThere is evidence that the click of death is a communicable disease;   a \u201cclicked\u201d disk can cause the read/write head of a \"clean\"   drive to become misaligned.

        "content": " Hackish speech makes heavy use of pseudo-mathematical metaphors.   Four particularly important ones involve the terms coefficient, factor, index of   X, and quotient.  They are   often loosely applied to things you cannot really be quantitative about,   but there are subtle distinctions among them that convey information about   the way the speaker mentally models whatever he or she is describing.   Foo factor and foo quotient tend to describe something for   which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical example is   fudge factor.  It's not important how much you're   fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed.  You   might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor.  Quotient tends to   imply that the property is a ratio of two opposing factors: \u201cI would   have won except for my luck quotient.\u201d This could also be \u201cI   would have won except for the luck factor\u201d, but using   quotient emphasizes that it was bad luck overpowering   good luck (or someone else's good luck overpowering your own).  Foo index and coefficient of foo both tend to imply that foo   is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that can be larger or   smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or person as having a high bogosity index, whereas you would be less   likely to speak of a high bogosity   factor.  Foo index   suggests that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane   cost-of-living index; coefficient of   foo suggests that foo is a fundamental quantity, as in a   coefficient of friction.  The choice between these terms is often one of   personal preference; e.g., some people might feel that bogosity is a   fundamental attribute and thus say coefficient   of bogosity, whereas others might feel it is a combination of   factors and thus say bogosity   index."

A mythical subatomic particle that bears the unit quantity of   computation or information, in much the same way that an electron bears one   unit of electric charge (see also bogon).  An   elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons has been developed based   on the physical fact that the molecules in a solid object move more rapidly   as it is heated.  It is argued that an object melts because the molecules   have lost their information about where they are supposed to be (that is,   they have emitted computrons).  This explains why computers get so hot and   require air conditioning; they use up computrons.  Conversely, it should be   possible to cool down an object by placing it in the path of a computron   beam.  It is believed that this may also explain why machines that work at   the factory fail in the computer room: the computrons there have been all   used up by the other hardware.

Intel could not explain   random bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis was cosmic rays.   So they created the World's Largest Lead Safe, using 25 tons of the stuff,   and used two identical boards for testing.  One was placed in the safe, one   outside.  The hypothesis was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit   drops, they should see a statistically significant difference between the   error rates on the two boards.  They did not observe such a difference.   Further investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due   to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser degree   uranium) in the encapsulation material.  Since it is impossible to   eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly distributed through the   earth's crust, with the statistically insignificant exception of uranium   lodes) it became obvious that one has to design memories to withstand these   hits."

An earlier attempt to establish worm in this sense around 1981--82 on Usenet   was largely a failure.\nUse of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against the   theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. The neologism   \u201ccracker\u201d in this sense may have been influenced not so much   by the term \u201csafe-cracker\u201d as by the non-jargon term   \u201ccracker\u201d, which in Middle English meant an obnoxious person   (e.g., \u201cWhat cracker is this same that deafs our ears / With this   abundance of superfluous breath?\u201d \u2014 Shakespeare's King John, Act   II, Scene I) and in modern colloquial American English survives as a barely   gentler synonym for \u201cwhite trash\u201d.\nWhile it is expected that any real hacker will have done some playful   cracking and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past   larval stage is expected to have outgrown the desire   to do so except for immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example, if   it's necessary to get around some security in order to get some work   done).\nThus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom than   the mundane reader misled by sensationalistic   journalism might expect.  Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit,   very secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open   poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to describe   themselves as hackers, most true hackers consider them   a separate and lower form of life.  An easy way for outsiders to spot   the difference is that crackers use grandiose screen names that conceal   their identities.  Hackers never do this; they only rarely use   noms de guerre at all, and when they   do it is for display rather than concealment.\nEthical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't   imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than breaking   into someone else's has to be pretty losing.  Some   other reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the entries on   cracking and phreaking.  See   also samurai,    dark-side hacker, and hacker ethic.

To reduce the size of a   file by a complicated scheme that produces bit configurations completely   unrelated to the original data, such as by a Huffman code.  (The file ends   up looking something like a paper document would if somebody crunched the   paper into a wad.)

Gibson's   near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture   enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the   future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly na\ufffdve and   tremendously stimulating.  Gibson's work was widely imitated, in particular   by the short-lived but innovative Max Headroom TV   series.  See cyberspace, ice,   jack in, go flatline.\nSince 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or fashion   trend that calls itself \u2018cyberpunk\u2019, associated especially with   the rave/techno subculture.  Hackers have mixed feelings about this.  On   the one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to be shallow   trendoids in black leather who have substituted enthusiastic blathering   about technology for actually learning and doing it.   Attitude is no substitute for competence.  On the other hand, at least   cyberpunks are excited about the right things and properly respectful of   hacking talent in those who have it.

The idea is that the   perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking   (though often a program will commit an action only because it knows that it   will implicitly invoke a daemon).  For example, under   ITS, writing a file on the LPT spooler's directory   would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file.  The   advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files printed need   neither compete for access to nor understand any idiosyncrasies of the LPT.   They simply enter their implicit requests and let the daemon decide what to   do with them.  Daemons are usually spawned automatically by the system, and   may either live forever or be regenerated at intervals.\nDaemon and demon are often used   interchangeably, but seem to have distinct connotations.  The term   daemon was introduced to computing by   CTSS people (who pronounced it /dee\ufffdmon/) and used it to refer to   what ITS called a dragon; the prototype was a   program called DAEMON that automatically made tape backups of the file   system.

Demoscene folklore   recounts that when old-time warez d00dz cracked some   piece of software they often added an advertisement in the beginning,   usually containing colorful display hacks with   greetings to other cracking groups.  The demoscene was born among people   who decided building these display hacks is more interesting than hacking   \u2014 or anyway safer.  Around 1990 there began to be very serious police   pressure on cracking groups, including raids with SWAT teams crashing into   bedrooms to confiscate computers.  Whether in response to this or for   esthetic reasons, crackers of that period began to build self-contained   display hacks of considerable elaboration and beauty (within the culture   such a hack is called a demo).  As more of these   demogroups emerged, they started to have   compos at copying parties (see   copyparty), which later evolved to standalone events   (see demoparty).  The demoscene has retained some   traits from the warez d00dz, including their style   of handles and group names and some of their jargon.\nTraditionally demos were written in assembly language, with lots of   smart tricks, self-modifying code, undocumented op-codes and the like.   Some time around 1995, people started coding demos in C, and a couple of   years after that, they also started using Java.\nTen years on (in 1998-1999), the demoscene is changing as its   original platforms (C64, Amiga, Spectrum, Atari ST, IBM PC under DOS) die   out and activity shifts towards Windows, Linux, and the Internet.  While   deeply underground in the past, demoscene is trying to get into the   mainstream as accepted art form, and one symptom of this is the   commercialization of bigger demoparties. Older demosceners frown at this,   but the majority think it's a good direction.  Many demosceners end up   working in the computer game industry.

[now obs.] A security or copy protection   device for proprietary software consisting of a serialized EPROM and some   drivers in a D-25 connector shell, which must be connected to an I/O port   of the computer while the program is run.  Programs that use a dongle query   the port at startup and at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate   if it does not respond with the dongle's programmed validation code.  Thus,   users can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay for   each dongle.  The first sighting of a dongle was in 1984, associated with a   software product called PaperClip.  The idea was clever, but it was   initially a failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this way. By   1993, dongles would typically pass data through the port and monitor for   magic codes (and combinations of status lines) with   minimal if any interference with devices further down the line \u2014 this   innovation was necessary to allow daisy-chained dongles for multiple pieces   of software.  These devices have become rare as the industry has moved away   from copy-protection schemes in general.  \n 2. By extension, any physical electronic key or transferable ID   required for a program to function.  Common variations on this theme have   used parallel or even joystick ports.

A typical MIT comment was that the Stanford    bucky bits (control and meta shifting keys) were nice, but there   weren't enough of them; you could type only 512 different characters on a   Stanford keyboard.  An obvious way to address this was simply to add more   shifting keys, and this was eventually done; but a keyboard with that many   shifting keys is hard on touch-typists, who don't like to move their hands   away from the home position on the keyboard.  It was half-seriously   suggested that the extra shifting keys be implemented as pedals; typing on   such a keyboard would be very much like playing a full pipe organ.

Users of the PLATO   educational system    report using emoticons composed from overlaid dot-matrix graphics   in the 1970s.\nNote for the newbie: Overuse of the smiley is   a mark of loserhood!

In   French, the term papillon (butterfly) has   been reported.

First on the standard list of    metasyntactic variables used in syntax examples.  See also   bar, baz,   qux, quux,   garply, waldo,   fred, plugh,   xyzzy, thud.\nWhen \u2018foo\u2019 is used in connection with \u2018bar\u2019   it has generally traced to the WWII-era Army slang acronym   FUBAR (\u2018Fucked Up Beyond All Repair\u2019 or   \u2018Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition\u2019), later modified to   foobar.  Early versions of the Jargon File   interpreted this change as a post-war bowdlerization, but it it now seems   more likely that FUBAR was itself a derivative of \u2018foo\u2019 perhaps   influenced by German furchtbar (terrible)   \u2014 \u2018foobar\u2019 may actually have been the   original form.\nFor, it seems, the word \u2018foo\u2019 itself had an immediate   prewar history in comic strips and cartoons.  The earliest documented uses   were in the Smokey Stover comic strip published from   about 1930 to about 1952.  Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled it   with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other nonsense phrases   such as \u201cNotary Sojac\u201d and \u201c1506 nix nix\u201d.  The   word \u201cfoo\u201d frequently appeared on license plates of cars, in   nonsense sayings in the background of some frames (such as \u201cHe who   foos last foos best\u201d or \u201cMany smoke but foo men chew\u201d),   and Holman had Smokey say \u201cWhere there's foo, there's   fire\u201d.\nAccording to the    Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion Holman claimed to have found the   word \u201cfoo\u201d on the bottom of a Chinese figurine.  This is   plausible; Chinese statuettes often have apotropaic inscriptions, and this   one was almost certainly the Mandarin Chinese word   fu (sometimes transliterated   foo), which can mean   \u201chappiness\u201d or \u201cprosperity\u201d when spoken with the   rising tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese   restaurants are properly called \u201cfu dogs\u201d).  English speakers'   reception of Holman's \u2018foo\u2019 nonsense word was undoubtedly   influenced by Yiddish \u2018feh\u2019 and English \u2018fooey\u2019 and   \u2018fool\u2019.\nHolman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode on   two wheels.  The comic strip was tremendously popular in the late 1930s,   and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even produced an operable   version of Holman's Foomobile.  According to the Encyclopedia of American   Comics, \u2018Foo\u2019 fever swept the U.S., finding its way into   popular songs and generating over 500 \u2018Foo Clubs.\u2019 The fad left   \u2018foo\u2019 references embedded in popular culture (including a   couple of appearances in Warner Brothers cartoons of 1938-39; notably in   Robert Clampett's \u201cDaffy Doc\u201d of 1938, in which a very early   version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying \u201cSILENCE IS   FOO!\u201d) When the fad faded, the origin of \u201cfoo\u201d was   forgotten.\nOne place \u201cfoo\u201d is known to have remained live is in the   U.S. military during the WWII years.  In 1944-45, the term \u2018foo   fighters\u2019 was in use by radar operators for the kind of mysterious or   spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the older term resurfaced   in popular American usage in 1995 via the name of one of the better   grunge-rock bands).  Because informants connected the term directly to the   Smokey Stover strip, the folk etymology that connects it to French   \u201cfeu\u201d (fire) can be gently dismissed.\nThe U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped slang terms during   the war (see kluge and kludge   for another important example) Period sources reported that   \u2018FOO\u2019 became a semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army   graffiti more or less equivalent to the American Kilroy.  Where British   troops went, the graffito \u201cFOO was here\u201d or something similar   showed up.  Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came from   Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous   \u201cFUBAR\u201d) was probably a backronym .   Forty years later, Paul Dickson's excellent book \u201cWords\u201d   (Dell, 1982, ISBN 0-440-52260-7) traced \u201cFoo\u201d to an   unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows:   \u201cMr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with bitter   omniscience and sarcasm.\u201d\nEarlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that hacker   usage actually sprang from FOO, Lampoons and Parody,   the title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint project   of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in his mid-teens)   later became one of the most important and influential artists in   underground comics, this venture was hardly a success; indeed, the brothers   later burned most of the existing copies in disgust.  The title FOO was   featured in large letters on the front cover.  However, very few copies of   this comic actually circulated, and students of Crumb's   oeuvre have established that this title was   a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover comics.  The Crumbs may also have   been influenced by a short-lived Canadian parody magazine named   \u2018Foo\u2019 published in 1951-52.\nAn old-time member reports that in the 1959 Dictionary of   the TMRC Language, compiled at TMRC,   there was an entry that went something like this:\nFOO: The first syllable of the sacred chant phrase \u201cFOO MANE PADMEHUM.\u201d Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.\n(For more about the legendary foo counters, see   TMRC.)  This definition used Bill Holman's nonsense   word, then only two decades old and demonstrably still live in popular   culture and slang, to a ha ha only serious analogy   with esoteric Tibetan Buddhism.  Today's hackers would find it difficult to   resist elaborating a joke like that, and it is not likely 1959's were any   less susceptible. Almost the entire staff of what later became the MIT AI   Lab was involved with TMRC, and the word spread from there."

Such a   project is usually perpetrated by people who aren't very good hackers or   find programming distasteful or are just in a hurry.

R1 (also known as \u2018The Rice   Institute Computer\u2019 (TRIC) and later as \u2018The Rice University   Computer\u2019 (TRUC)) had a single-step/free-run switch for use when   debugging programs.  Since single-stepping through a large program was   rather tedious, there was also a crank with a cam and gear arrangement that   repeatedly pushed the single-step button.  This allowed one to   \u2018crank\u2019 through a lot of code, then slow down to single-step   for a bit when you got near the code of interest, poke at some registers   using the console typewriter, and then keep on cranking.  See http://www.cs.rice.edu/History/R1/."

The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is   ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach   of confidentiality.\nBoth of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no   means universally, accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the   hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away   open-source software.  A few go further and assert that   all information should be free and   any proprietary control of it is bad; this is the   philosophy behind the GNU project.\nSense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of   cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.  But the   belief that \u2018ethical\u2019 cracking excludes destruction at least   moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as \u2018benign\u2019   crackers (see also samurai, gray   hat).

Huge cooperative networks such as Usenet,   FidoNet and the Internet itself can function without   central control because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a   sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible   asset."

There are four major C indent styles, described below;   all have the aim of making it easier for the reader to visually track the   scope of control constructs.  They have been inherited by C++ and Java,   which have C-like syntaxes.  The significant variable is the placement of   { and } with respect to the   statement(s) they enclose and to the guard or controlling statement   (if, else,   for, while,   or do) on the block, if any.\nK&R style \u2014 Named   after Kernighan & Ritchie, because the examples in K&R are formatted this way.  Also   called kernel style because the Unix   kernel is written in it, and the \u2018One True Brace Style\u2019   (abbrev. 1TBS) by its partisans.  In C code, the body is typically indented   by eight spaces (or one tab) per level, as shown here. Four spaces are   occasionally seen in C, but in C++ and Java four tends to be the rule   rather than the exception.\nif\ufffd(<cond>)\ufffd{\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd<body>}\nAllman style \u2014 Named for   Eric Allman, a Berkeley hacker who wrote a lot of the BSD utilities in it   (it is sometimes called BSD style).   Resembles normal indent style in Pascal and Algol.  It is the only style   other than K&R in widespread use among Java programmers. Basic indent   per level shown here is eight spaces, but four (or sometimes three) spaces   are generally preferred by C++ and Java programmers.\nif\ufffd(<cond>){\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd<body>}\nWhitesmiths style \u2014   popularized by the examples that came with Whitesmiths C, an early   commercial C compiler.

Indents are always four spaces per level, with { and } halfway   between the outer and inner indent levels.\nif\ufffd(<cond>)\ufffd\ufffd{\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd<body>\ufffd\ufffd}\nSurveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most   common, with about equal mind shares.  K&R/1TBS used to be nearly   universal, but is now much less common in C (the opening brace tends to get   lost against the right paren of the guard part in an if or while, which   is a Bad Thing).  Defenders of 1TBS argue that any   putative gain in readability is less important than their style's relative   economy with vertical space, which enables one to see more code on one's   screen at once.  The Java Language Specification legislates not only the   capitalization of identifiers, but where nouns, adjectives, and verbs   should be in method, class, interface, and variable names (section   6.8). While the specification stops short of also standardizing on a   bracing style, all source code originating from Sun Laboratories uses the   K&R style.  This has set a precedent for Java programmers, which most   follow.\nDoubtless these issues will continue to be the subject of   holy wars."

Also, \u2018kludge\u2019 is more widely known in British mainstream slang   than \u2018kluge\u2019 is in the U.S."

A Rube Goldberg (or Heath   Robinson) device, whether in hardware or software.  \n 2. n. A clever programming trick   intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear,   manner.  Often used to repair bugs.  Often involves   ad-hockery and verges on being a   crock.  \n 3. n. Something that works for   the wrong reason.  \n 4. vt. To insert a kluge into a   program.  \u201cI've kluged this routine to get around that weird bug, but   there's probably a better way.\u201d \n 5. [WPI] n. A feature that is   implemented in a rude manner.\nNowadays this term is often encountered in the variant spelling   \u2018kludge\u2019.  Reports from old farts are   consistent that \u2018kluge\u2019 was the original spelling, reported   around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used   exclusively of hardware kluges.  In 1947, the   New York Folklore Quarterly reported a classic   shaggy-dog story \u2018Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker\u2019 then current in   the Armed Forces, in which a \u2018kluge\u2019 was a complex and puzzling   artifact with a trivial function.  Other sources report that   \u2018kluge\u2019 was common Navy slang in the WWII era for any piece of   electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at   sea.\nHowever, there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade   older.  Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of a device   called a \u201cKluge paper feeder\u201d, an adjunct to mechanical   printing presses.  Legend has it that the Kluge feeder was designed before   small, cheap electric motors and control electronics; it relied on a   fiendishly complex assortment of cams, belts, and linkages to both power   and synchronize all its operations from one motive driveshaft.  It was   accordingly temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly   difficult to repair \u2014 but oh, so clever!  People who tell this story   also aver that \u2018Kluge\u2019 was the name of a design   engineer.\nThere is in fact a Brandtjen & Kluge Inc., an old family business   that manufactures printing equipment \u2014 interestingly, their name is   pronounced /kloo\ufffdgee/!   Henry Brandtjen, president of the firm, told me (ESR, 1994) that his   company was co-founded by his father and an engineer named Kluge /kloo\ufffdgee/, who built and co-designed   the original Kluge automatic feeder in 1919.  Mr. Brandtjen claims,   however, that this was a simple device (with only four   cams); he says he has no idea how the myth of its complexity took hold.   Other correspondents differ with Mr. Brandtjen's history of the device and   his allegation that it was a simple rather than complex one, but agree that   the Kluge automatic feeder was the most likely source of the   folklore.\nTMRC and the MIT hacker culture of the early   '60s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used   some WWII military slang (see also foobar).  It   seems likely that \u2018kluge\u2019 came to MIT via alumni of the many   military electronics projects that had been located in Cambridge (many in   MIT's venerable Building 20, in which TMRC is also   located) during the war.\nThe variant \u2018kludge\u2019 was apparently popularized by the   Datamation article mentioned under   kludge; it was titled How to Design a   Kludge (February 1962, pp. 30, 31).  This spelling was probably   imported from Great Britain, where kludge has an   independent history (though this fact was largely unknown to hackers on   either side of the Atlantic before a mid-1993 debate in the Usenet group   alt.folklore.computers over the   First and Second Edition versions of this entry; everybody used to think   kludge was just a mutation of   kluge).  It now appears that the British, having   forgotten the etymology of their own \u2018kludge\u2019 when   \u2018kluge\u2019 crossed the Atlantic, repaid the U.S. by lobbing the   \u2018kludge\u2019 orthography in the other direction and confusing their   American cousins' spelling!\nThe result of this history is a tangle.  Many younger U.S. hackers   pronounce the word as /klooj/ but   spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as   \u2018kludge\u2019. (Phonetically, consider huge, refuge, centrifuge, and   deluge as opposed to sludge, judge, budge, and fudge.  Whatever its   failings in other areas, English spelling is perfectly consistent about   this distinction.)  British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted   negative sense and are at least consistent.  European hackers have mostly   learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it   /kluhj/ but use the wider   American meaning!\nSome observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's   meaning."

The  posting   was actually forged by Piet Beertema as an April Fool's joke.  Other   fictitious sites mentioned in the hoax were moskvax and kgbvax.   This was probably the funniest of the many April Fool's forgeries   perpetrated on Usenet (which has negligible security against them), because   the notion that Usenet might ever penetrate the Iron Curtain seemed so   totally absurd at the time.\nIn fact, it was only six years later that the first genuine site in   Moscow, demos.su, joined Usenet.   Some readers needed convincing that the postings from it weren't just   another prank.  Vadim Antonov, senior programmer at Demos and the major   poster from there up to mid-1991, was quite aware of all this, referred to   it frequently in his own postings, and at one point twitted some credulous   readers by blandly asserting that he was a   hoax!\nEventually he even arranged to have the domain's gateway site named   kremvax, thus neatly turning   fiction into fact and demonstrating that the hackish sense of humor   transcends cultural barriers.  [Mr. Antonov also contributed the   Russian-language material for this lexicon. \u2014ESR]\nIn an even more ironic historical footnote, kremvax became an electronic center of the   anti-communist resistance during the bungled hard-line coup of August 1991.   During those three days the Soviet UUCP network centered on kremvax became the only trustworthy news   source for many places within the USSR.  Though the sysops were   concentrating on internal communications, cross-border postings included   immediate transliterations of Boris Yeltsin's decrees condemning the coup   and eyewitness reports of the demonstrations in Moscow's streets.  In those   hours, years of speculation that totalitarianism would prove unable to   maintain its grip on politically-loaded information in the age of computer   networking were proved devastatingly accurate \u2014 and the original   kremvax joke became a reality as   Yeltsin and the new Russian revolutionaries of glasnost and perestroika made kremvax one of the timeliest means of their   outreach to the West."

During the early 1970s, macro assemblers became   ubiquitous, and sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as   HLLs, only to fall from favor as improving compiler   technology marginalized assembler programming (see    languages of choice).  Nowadays the term is most often used in connection   with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one of several special-purpose languages   built around a macro-expansion facility (such as TeX or Unix's [nt]roff   suite).\nIndeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective macros is now sometimes used for code in any   special-purpose application control language (whether or not the language   is actually translated by text expansion), and for macro-like entities such   as the keyboard macros supported in   some text editors (and PC TSR or Macintosh INIT/CDEV keyboard   enhancers)."

Magic numbers in this sense are bad style.   \n 2. A number that encodes critical information used in an algorithm   in some opaque way.  The classic examples of these are the numbers used in   hash or CRC functions, or the coefficients in a linear congruential   generator for pseudo-random numbers.  This sense actually predates and was   ancestral to the more common sense\n 3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file to   indicate its type to a utility.  Under Unix, the system and various   applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish between types of   executable file by looking for a magic number.  Once upon a time, these   magic numbers were PDP-11 branch instructions that   skipped over header data to the start of executable code; 0407, for   example, was octal for \u2018branch 16 bytes relative\u2019.  Many other   kinds of files now have magic numbers somewhere; some magic numbers are, in   fact, strings, like the !<arch> at the beginning   of a Unix archive file or the %! leading PostScript   files.  Nowadays only a wizard knows the spells to   create magic numbers.  How do you choose a fresh magic number of your own?   Simple \u2014 you pick one at random.  See?  It's magic!  \n 4. An input that leads to a computational boundary condition, where   algorithm behavior becomes discontinuous.  Numeric overflows (particularly   with signed data types) and run-time errors (divide by zero, stack   overflows) are indications of magic numbers.  The Y2K scare was probably   the most notorious magic number non-incident.\nThe magic number, on the other hand, is   7\ufffd2.  See The magical   number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing   information by George Miller, in the Psychological   Review 63:81-97 (1956).

The people who receive your email when you send it to such an   address.\nMailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker interaction,   along with Usenet.  They predate Usenet, having   originated with the first UUCP and ARPANET connections.  They are often   used for private information-sharing on topics that would be too   specialized for or inappropriate to public Usenet groups.  Though some of   these maintain almost purely technical content (such as the Internet   Engineering Task Force mailing list), others (like the   \u2018sf-lovers\u2019 list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe) are   recreational, and many are purely social.  Perhaps the most infamous of the   social lists was the eccentric bandykin distribution; its latter-day progeny,   lectroids and tanstaafl, still include a number of the   oddest and most interesting people in hackerdom.\nMailing lists are easy to create and (unlike Usenet) don't tie up a   significant amount of machine resources (until they get very large, at   which point they can become interesting torture tests for mail software).   Thus, they are often created temporarily by working groups, the members of   which can then collaborate on a project without ever needing to meet   face-to-face.

Thus, ordering a \u201cmoby Coke\u201d at the   local fast-food joint is not just a request for a large Coke, it's an   explicit request for the largest size they sell.\nThis term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to   the MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge when it   was installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical memory size for a   timesharing system was 72 kilobytes).  Thus, a moby is classically 256K   36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or PDP-10 moby.  Back when address   registers were narrow the term was more generally useful, because when a   computer had virtual memory mapping, it might actually have more physical   memory attached to it than any one program could access directly.  One   could then say \u201cThis computer has 6 mobies\u201d meaning that the   ratio of physical memory to address space is 6, without having to say   specifically how much memory there actually is.  That in turn implied that   the computer could timeshare six \u2018full-sized\u2019 programs without   having to swap programs between memory and disk.\nNowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces   are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto a   machine, so most systems have much less than one   theoretical \u2018native\u2019 moby of core.   Also, more modern memory-management techniques (esp. paging) make the   \u2018moby count\u2019 less significant.  However, there is one series of   widely-used chips for which the term could stand to be revived \u2014 the   Intel 8088 and 80286 with their incredibly   brain-damaged segmented-memory designs.  On these, a   moby would be the 1-megabyte address   span of a segment/offset pair (by coincidence, a PDP-10 moby was exactly 1   megabyte of 9-bit bytes)."

See   glitch, bug,    deep space, wedged.\nThis term is much older than computing, and is (uncommon) slang   elsewhere.  A trolley is the small wheel that trolls, or runs against, the   heavy wire that carries the current to run a streetcar.  It's at the end of   the long pole (the trolley pole) that reaches from the roof of the   streetcar to the overhead line.  When the trolley stops making contact with   the wire (from passing through a switch, going over bumpy track, or   whatever), the streetcar comes to a halt, (usually) without crashing.  The   streetcar is then said to be off the trolley, or off the wire.  Later on,   trolley came to mean the streetcar itself.  Since streetcars became common   in the 1890s, the term is more than 100 years old.  Nowadays, trolleys are   only seen on historic streetcars, since modern streetcars use pantographs   to contact the wire."

There was a little subroutine that had   traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an   approximation to the moon's true phase.  GLS incorporated this routine into   a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would print a timestamp line   almost 80 characters long.  Very occasionally the first line of the message   would be too long and would overflow onto the next line, and when the file   was later read back in the program would barf.  The   length of the first line depended on both the precise date and time and the   length of the phase specification when the timestamp was printed, and so   the bug literally depended on the phase of the moon!\nThe first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included an   example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but the   typesetter \u2018corrected\u2019 it.  This has since been described as   the phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.\nHowever, beware of assumptions.  A few years ago, engineers of CERN   (European Center for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors in   experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator.  As the formidable   amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed by computers   before being seen by humans, many people suggested the software was somehow   sensitive to the phase of the moon.  A few desperate engineers discovered   the truth; the error turned out to be the result of a tiny change in the   geometry of the 27km circumference ring, physically caused by the   deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon!  This story has   entered physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle physics and   as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest physical laws to   the most modern science."

There was significant crossover between the hacker community and the   hard-core phone phreaks who ran semi-underground networks of their own   through such media as the legendary TAP Newsletter.   This ethos began to break down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of   the techniques put them in the hands of less responsible phreaks.  Around   the same time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical   ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came to   depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card numbers.   The crimes and punishments of gangs like the \u2018414 group\u2019 turned   that game very ugly.

There is   a widespread myth that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used   for that era's larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have   falsified this.\nIBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married   the punched card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns of   small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per card.   Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at various   times.\nThe 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the   IBM punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed   with many varieties of computers even today.

The binary peta- and exa- loadings, though well   established, are not in jargon use either \u2014 yet.  The prefix milli-,   denoting multiplication by 1/1000, has   always been rare in jargon (there is, however, a standard joke about the   millihelen \u2014 notionally, the   amount of beauty required to launch one ship).

In the following table, the \u2018prefix\u2019 column is the   international standard prefix for the appropriate power of ten; the   \u2018binary\u2019 column lists jargon abbreviations and words for the   corresponding power of 2.

This is also true (though less commonly)   of G.\nNote that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is \u2018k\u2019;   some use this strictly, reserving \u2018K\u2019 for multiplication by   1024 (KB is thus \u2018kilobytes\u2019).\nK, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is 64   gigabytes and \u2018a K\u2019 is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of   \u2018a G\u2019 as short for \u2018a grand\u2019, that is, $1000).   Whether one pronounces \u2018gig\u2019 with hard or soft \u2018g\u2019   depends on what one thinks the proper pronunciation of \u2018giga-\u2019   is.\nConfusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in   magnitude) \u2014 for example, describing a memory in units of 500K or   524K instead of 512K \u2014 is a sure sign of the   marketroid.  One example of this: it is common to   refer to the capacity of 3.5\" floppies as \u20181.44 MB\u2019 In   fact, this is a completely bogus number.  The   correct size is 1440 KB, that is, 1440 * 1024 = 1474560 bytes.  So the   \u2018mega\u2019 in \u20181.44 MB\u2019 is compounded of two   \u2018kilos\u2019, one of which is 1024 and the other of which is 1000.   The correct number of megabytes would of course be 1440 / 1024 = 1.40625.   Alas, this fine point is probably lost on the world forever.  [1993 update:   hacker Morgan Burke has proposed, to general approval on Usenet, the   following additional prefixes:\nWe observe that this would leave the prefixes zeppo-, gummo-, and   chico- available for future expansion.  Sadly, there is little immediate   prospect that Mr. Burke's eminently sensible proposal will be   ratified.]"

In this respect it is very much   like a photon.  However, it has a much greater momentum, thus explaining   its destructive effect on computer electronics and human nervous systems.   The corollary to this is that bogons also have tremendous inertia, and   therefore a bogon beam is deflected only with great difficulty.  When the   bogon encounters its antiparticle, the cluon, they mutually annihilate each   other, releasing magic smoke.  Furthermore 1 Lenat = 1 mole (6.022E23) of   bogons (see microLenat)."

        "content": " [WPI] A cuspy but bogus raving story about   N random broken people.\nHere is a classic example of the saga form, as told by Guy L.   Steele:\nJon L. White (login name JONL) and I (GLS) were office mates at MIT   for many years.  One April, we both flew from Boston to California for a   week on research business, to consult face-to-face with some people at   Stanford, particularly our mutual friend Richard P.  Gabriel (RPG).\nRPG picked us up at the San Francisco airport and drove us back to   Palo Alto (going logical south on route 101,   parallel to El Camino Bignum).  Palo Alto is   adjacent to Stanford University and about 40 miles south of San Francisco.   We ate at The Good Earth, a \u2018health food\u2019 restaurant, very   popular, the sort whose milkshakes all contain honey and protein powder.   JONL ordered such a shake \u2014 the waitress claimed the flavor of the   day was \u201clalaberry\u201d.  I still have no idea what that might be,   but it became a running joke.  It was the color of raspberry, and JONL said   it tasted rather bitter.  I ate a better tostada there than I have ever had   in a Mexican restaurant.\nAfter this we went to the local Uncle Gaylord's Old Fashioned Ice   Cream Parlor.  They make ice cream fresh daily, in a variety of intriguing   flavors.  It's a chain, and they have a slogan: \u201cIf you don't live   near an Uncle Gaylord's \u2014 MOVE!\u201d Also, Uncle Gaylord (a real   person) wages a constant battle to force big-name ice cream makers to print   their ingredients on the package (like air and plastic and other   non-natural garbage).  JONL and I had first discovered Uncle Gaylord's the   previous August, when we had flown to a computer-science conference in   Berkeley, California, the first time either of us had been on the West   Coast.  When not in the conference sessions, we had spent our time   wandering the length of Telegraph Avenue, which (like Harvard Square in   Cambridge) was lined with picturesque street vendors and interesting little   shops.  On that street we discovered Uncle Gaylord's Berkeley store.  The   ice cream there was very good.  During that August visit JONL went   absolutely bananas (so to speak) over one particular flavor, ginger   honey.\nTherefore, after eating at The Good Earth \u2014 indeed, after every   lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit \u2014 a trip to   Uncle Gaylord's (the one in Palo Alto) was mandatory.  We had arrived on a   Wednesday, and by Thursday evening we had been there at least four times.   Each time, JONL would get ginger honey ice cream, and proclaim to all   bystanders that \u201cGinger was the spice that drove the Europeans mad!   That's why they sought a route to the East!  They used it to preserve their   otherwise off-taste meat.\u201d After the third or fourth repetition RPG   and I were getting a little tired of this spiel, and began to paraphrase   him: \u201cWow!  Ginger!  The spice that makes rotten meat taste   good!\u201d \u201cSay!  Why don't we find some dog that's been run over   and sat in the sun for a week and put some ginger on   it for dinner?!\u201d \u201cRight!  With a lalaberry shake!\u201d And   so on.  This failed to faze JONL; he took it in good humor, as long as we   kept returning to Uncle Gaylord's.  He loves ginger honey ice cream.\nNow RPG and his then-wife KBT (Kathy Tracy) were putting us up   (putting up with us?) in their home for our visit, so to thank them JONL   and I took them out to a nice French restaurant of their choosing.  I   unadventurously chose the filet mignon, and KBT had je   ne sais quoi du jour, but RPG and JONL had lapin (rabbit).  (Waitress: \u201cOui, we have fresh rabbit, fresh today.\u201d RPG:   \u201cWell, JONL, I guess we won't need any   ginger!\u201d)\nWe finished the meal late, about 11PM, which is 2AM Boston time, so   JONL and I were rather droopy.  But it wasn't yet midnight.  Off to Uncle   Gaylord's!\nNow the French restaurant was in Redwood City, north of Palo Alto.   In leaving Redwood City, we somehow got onto route 101 going north instead   of south.  JONL and I wouldn't have known the difference had RPG not   mentioned it.  We still knew very little of the local geography.  I did   figure out, however, that we were headed in the direction of Berkeley, and   half-jokingly suggested that we continue north and go to Uncle Gaylord's in   Berkeley.\nRPG said \u201cFine!\u201d and we drove on for a while and talked.   I was drowsy, and JONL actually dropped off to sleep for 5 minutes.  When   he awoke, RPG said, \u201cGee, JONL, you must have slept all the way over   the bridge!\u201d, referring to the one spanning San Francisco Bay.  Just   then we came to a sign that said \u201cUniversity Avenue\u201d.  I   mumbled something about working our way over to Telegraph Avenue; RPG said   \u201cRight!\u201d and maneuvered some more.  Eventually we pulled up in   front of an Uncle Gaylord's.\nNow, I hadn't really been paying attention because I was so sleepy,   and I didn't really understand what was happening until RPG let me in on it   a few moments later, but I was just alert enough to notice that we had   somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle Gaylord's after all.\nJONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store, but hadn't   caught on.  (The place is lit with red and yellow lights at night, and   looks much different from the way it does in daylight.)  He said,   \u201cThis isn't the Uncle Gaylord's I went to in Berkeley!  It looked   like a barn!  But this place looks just like the one   back in Palo Alto!\u201d\nRPG deadpanned, \u201cWell, this is the one I   always come to when I'm in Berkeley.  They've got two in San Francisco,   too.  Remember, they're a chain.\u201d\nJONL accepted this bit of wisdom.  And he was not totally ignorant   \u2014 he knew perfectly well that University Avenue was in Berkeley, not   far from Telegraph Avenue.  What he didn't know was that there is a   completely different University Avenue in Palo Alto.\nJONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger honey.  The guy at   the counter asked whether JONL would like to taste it first, evidently   their standard procedure with that flavor, as not too many people like   it.\nJONL said, \u201cI'm sure I like it.  Just give me a cone.\u201d   The guy behind the counter insisted that JONL try just a taste first.   \u201cSome people think it tastes like soap.\u201d JONL insisted,   \u201cLook, I love ginger.  I eat Chinese food.  I   eat raw ginger roots.  I already went through this hassle with the guy back   in Palo Alto.  I know I like that   flavor!\u201d\nAt the words \u201cback in Palo Alto\u201d the guy behind the   counter got a very strange look on his face, but said nothing.  KBT caught   his eye and winked.  Through my stupor I still hadn't quite grasped what   was going on, and thought RPG was rolling on the floor laughing and   clutching his stomach just because JONL had launched into his spiel   (\u201cmakes rotten meat a dish for princes\u201d) for the forty-third   time.  At this point, RPG clued me in fully.\nRPG, KBT, and I retreated to a table, trying to stifle our chuckles.   JONL remained at the counter, talking about ice cream with the guy b.t.c.,   comparing Uncle Gaylord's to other ice cream shops and generally having a   good old time.\nAt length the g.b.t.c.: said, \u201cHow's the ginger honey?\u201d   JONL said, \u201cFine!  I wonder what exactly is in it?\u201d Now Uncle   Gaylord publishes all his recipes and even teaches classes on how to make   his ice cream at home.  So the g.b.t.c.: got out the recipe, and he and   JONL pored over it for a while.  But the g.b.t.c.: could contain his   curiosity no longer, and asked again, \u201cYou really like that stuff,   huh?\u201d JONL said, \u201cYeah, I've been eating it constantly back in   Palo Alto for the past two days.  In fact, I think this batch is about as   good as the cones I got back in Palo Alto!\u201d\nG.b.t.c.: looked him straight in the eye and said, \u201cYou're   in Palo Alto!\u201d\nJONL turned slowly around, and saw the three of us collapse in a fit   of giggles.  He clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed, \u201cI've   been hacked!\u201d\n[My spies on the West Coast inform me that there is a close relative   of the raspberry found out there called an \u2018ollalieberry\u2019   \u2014ESR]\n[Ironic footnote: the meme about ginger   vs. rotting meat is an urban legend.  It's not borne out by an examination   of medieval recipes or period purchase records for spices, and appears   full-blown in the works of Samuel Pegge, a gourmand and notorious flake   case who originated numerous food myths.  The truth seems to be that ginger   was used to cover not rot but the extreme salt taste of meat packed in   brine, which was the best method available before refrigeration.   \u2014ESR]"

(See also   molly-guard, TMRC.)\n\u201cScram\u201d was in origin a backronym for \u201cSafety Cut   Rope Axe Man\u201d coined by Enrico Fermi himself.  The story goes that   in the earliest nuclear power experiments the engineers recognized the   possibility that the reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted by their   mathematical models.  Accordingly, they made sure that they had mechanisms   in place that would rapidly drop the control rods back into the reactor.   One mechanism took the form of \u2018scram technicians\u2019.  These   individuals stood next to the ropes or cables that raised and lowered the   control rods.  Equipped with axes or cable-cutters, these technicians stood   ready for the (literal) \u2018scram\u2019 command.  If necessary, they   would cut the cables, and gravity would expeditiously return the control   rods to the reactor, thereby averting yet another kind of core   dump.\nModern reactor control rods are held in place with claw-like devices,   held closed by current.  SCRAM switches are circuit breakers that   immediately open the circuit to the rod arms, resulting in the rapid   insertion and subsequent bottoming of the control rods."

ITS fans, on the other hand, say it was   coined years earlier in opposition to the incredibly paranoid   Multics people down the hall, for whom security was   everything.  In the ITS culture it referred to (1) the fact that by the   time a tourist figured out how to make trouble he'd generally gotten over   the urge to make it, because he felt part of the community; and (2)   (self-mockingly) the poor coverage of the documentation and obscurity of   many commands.  One instance of deliberate security   through obscurity is recorded; the command to allow patching the running   ITS system (escape escape control-R) echoed as $$^D.

The user is meant to fill in whatever code is needed to get   real work done.  This usage is common in the AI and Microsoft Windows   worlds, and confuses Unix hackers.\nHistorical note: Apparently, the original Multics shell (sense 1) was   so called because it was a shell (sense 3); it ran user programs not by   starting up separate processes, but by dynamically linking the programs   into its own code, calling them as subroutines, and then dynamically   de-linking them on return.

Apparently Smoot's   experience as a unit of measurement led to a life-long career; he   eventually became Chairman of the Board of the American National Standards   Institute, and later President of the International Organization for   Standardization."

In   this context one also speaks of snapping   links.  For example, in a LISP implementation, a function   interface trampoline might check to make sure that the caller is passing   the correct number of arguments; if it is, and if the caller and the callee   are both compiled, then snapping the link allows that particular path to   use a direct procedure-call instruction with no further overhead."

More commonly,   software rot strikes when a program's   assumptions become out of date.  If the design was insufficiently   robust, this may cause it to fail in mysterious   ways. Syn. code rot.  See also   link rot.\nFor example, owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of COBOL   programs, a good number of them succumbed to software rot when their   2-digit year counters underwent wrap around at the   beginning of the year 2000.  Actually, related lossages often afflict   centenarians who have to deal with computer software designed by   unimaginative clods.  One such incident became the focus of a minor public   flap in 1990, when a gentleman born in 1889 applied for a driver's license   renewal in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The new system refused to issue the   card, probably because with 2-digit years the ages 101 and 1 cannot be   distinguished.\nHistorical note: Software rot in an even funnier sense than the   mythical one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g., the R1;   see grind crank).  If a program that depended on a   peculiar instruction hadn't been run in quite a while, the user might   discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they once did.   (\u201cHey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do such-and-such.  We can   snarf this opcode, right?  No one uses it.\u201d)   Another classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker found a   simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump instruction on a   PDP-6, so he patched the hardware.  Unfortunately, this broke some fragile   timing software in a music-playing program, throwing its output out of   tune.  This was fixed by adding a defensive initialization routine to   compare the speed of a timing loop with the real-time clock; in other   words, it figured out how fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected   appropriately.\nCompare bit rot."

Many keys had three symbols on them: a letter and a symbol on the top, and   a Greek letter on the front.  For example, the \u2018L\u2019 key had an   \u2018L\u2019 and a two-way arrow on the top, and the Greek letter lambda   on the front.  By pressing this key with the right hand while playing an   appropriate \u2018chord\u2019 with the left hand on the shift keys, you   could get the following results:\nAnd of course each of these might also be typed with any combination   of the control, meta, hyper, and super keys.  On this keyboard, you could   type over 8000 different characters!  This allowed the user to type very   complicated mathematical text, and also to have thousands of   single-character commands at his disposal.  The keyboard of the Symbolics   Lisp machine was a simplified version, lacking Top and Front keys, that   could only send about 2000 characters.\nMany hackers were actually willing to memorize the command meanings   of that many characters if it reduced typing time (this attitude obviously   shaped the interface of EMACS).  Other hackers, however, thought having   that many bucky bits was overkill, and objected that such a keyboard can   require three or four hands to operate.  See bucky   bits, cokebottle, double   bucky, meta bit, quadruple   bucky.\nSimplified Symbolics version of the space-cadet keyboard\n(Some relatively bad photographs of the earlier, more elaborate   version are available on   the Web.).\nNote: early versions of this entry incorrectly identified the   space-cadet keyboard with the Knight   keyboard.  Though both were designed by Tom Knight, the latter   term was properly applied only to a keyboard used for ITS on the PDP-10 and   modeled on the Stanford keyboard (as described under bucky   bits).  The true space-cadet keyboard evolved from the first   Knight keyboard.\nAn early space-cadet keyboard\n(The next cartoon in the Crunchly saga is       73-05-20. The previous one is       73-05-18.)"

It   combines the immediacy of talking with all the precision (and verbosity)   that written language entails.  It is difficult to communicate inflection,   though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section on   writing style in the Prependices for details).\nTalk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing,   which are not used orally.  Some of these are identical to (and probably   derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs since the   1920s.\nMost of these are not used at universities or in the Unix   world, though ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is   common; conversely, most of the people who know these are unfamiliar with   FOO?, BCNU, HELLOP, NIL, and   T.\nThe MUD community uses a mixture of   Usenet/Internet emoticons, a few of the more natural of the old-style   talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the \u2018social\u2019 list above;   specifically, MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF,   TTFN, and WTH.  The use of rehi is   also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re- compounds and will frequently   rehug or rebonk (see bonk/oif)   people.  The word re by itself is   taken as \u2018regreet\u2019.  In general, though, MUDders express a   preference for typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations;   this may be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to   include many touch typists and to assume high-speed links.  The following   uses specific to MUDs are reported:\nSome B1FFisms (notably the variant spelling   d00d) appear to be passing into wider use   among some subgroups of MUDders.\nOne final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode,   often seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because they are   typing rather than speaking.  This is not the best approach.  It can be   very frustrating to wait while your partner pauses to think of a word, or   repeatedly makes the same spelling error and backs up to fix it.  It is   usually best just to leave typographical errors behind and plunge forward,   unless severe confusion may result; in that case it is often fastest just   to type \u201cxxx\u201d and start over from before the mistake.\nSee also hakspek,   emoticon."

Ingerman, who invented thunks in 1961   as a way of binding actual parameters to their formal definitions in   Algol-60 procedure calls.  If a procedure is called with an expression in   the place of a formal parameter, the compiler generates a thunk which   computes the expression and leaves the address of the result in some   standard location.  \n 2. Later generalized into: an expression, frozen together with its   environment, for later evaluation if and when needed (similar to what in   techspeak is called a closure).  The   process of unfreezing these thunks is called forcing.  \n 3. A stubroutine, in an overlay programming   environment, that loads and jumps to the correct overlay.  Compare   trampoline.\n4.  Microsoft and IBM have both defined, in their Intel-based   systems, a \u201c16-bit environment\u201d (with bletcherous segment   registers and 64K address limits) and a \u201c32-bit environment\u201d   (with flat addressing and semi-real memory management). The two   environments can both be running on the same computer and OS (thanks to   what is called, in the Microsoft world, WOW which stands for Windows On   Windows). MS and IBM have both decided that the process of getting from 16-   to 32-bit and vice versa is called a \u201cthunk\u201d; for Windows 95,   there is even a tool THUNK.EXE called a \u201cthunk compiler\u201d.   \n 5. A person or activity scheduled in a thunklike manner.  \u201cIt   occurred to me the other day that I am rather accurately modeled by a thunk   \u2014 I frequently need to be forced to completion.:\u201d \u2014   paraphrased from a plan file.\nHistorical note: There are a couple of onomatopoeic myths circulating   about the origin of this term.  The most common is that it is the sound   made by data hitting the stack; another holds that the sound is that of the   data hitting an accumulator.  Yet another suggests that it is the sound of   the expression being unfrozen at argument-evaluation time.  In fact,   according to the inventors, it was coined after they realized (in the wee   hours after hours of discussion) that the type of an argument in Algol-60   could be figured out in advance with a little compile-time thought,   simplifying the evaluation machinery.  In other words, it had   \u2018already been thought of\u2019; thus it was christened a thunk, which is \u201cthe past tense of   \u2018think\u2019 at two in the morning\u201d."

        "content": "[now primarily historical] Timesharing is the technique of scheduling   a computer's time so that they are shared across multiple tasks and   multiple users, with each user having the illusion that his or her   computation is going on continuously.  John McCarthy, the inventor of   LISP, first imagined   this technique in the late 1950s.  The first timesharing operating   systems, BBN's \"Little Hospital\" and CTSS, were   deplayed in 1962-63.  The early hacker culture of the 1960s and 1970s grew   up around the first generation of relatively cheap timesharing computers,   notably the DEC 10, 11, and VAX lines.  But these   were only cheap in a relative sense; though quite a bit less powerful than   today's personal computers, they had to be shared by dozens or even   hundreds of people each.  The early hacker comunities nucleated around   places where it was relatively easy to get access to a timesharing   account.\nNowadays, communications bandwidth is usually the most important    constraint on what you can do with your computer.  Not so back then;   timesharing machines were often loaded to capacity, and it was not uncommon    for everyone's work to grind to a halt while the machine scheduler   thrashed, trying to figure out what to do next.  Early hacker slang   was replete with terms like cycle   crunch and cycle drought   for describing the consequences of too few instructions-per-second spread   among too many users.  As GLS has noted, this sort of problem influenced   the tendency of many hackers to work odd schedules.\nOne reason this is worth noting here is to make the point that the   earliest hacker communities were physical, not distributed via networks;   they consisted of hackers who shared a machine and therefore had to deal   with many of the same problems with respect to it.  A system crash could   idle dozens of eager programmers, all sitting in the same terminal room and   with little to do but talk with each other until normal operation   resumed.\nTimesharing moved from being the luxury of a few large universities   runing semi-experimental operating systems to being more generally   available about 1975-76. Hackers in search of more cycles and more control   over their programming environment began to migrate off timesharing   machines and onto what are now called workstations around 1983.  It took another ten   years, the development of powerful 32-bit personal micros, the   Great Internet Explosion before the migration was   complete.  It is no coincidence that the last stages of this migration   coincided with the development of the first open-source operating   systems."

A companion program,   nroff, formats output for terminals and line   printers.\nIn 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive   phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT.

It has proven aremarkably robust tool, taking unbelievable abuse from avariety of preprocessors and being forced into uses thatwere never conceived of in the original design, all withconsiderable grace under fire.\nThe success of TeX and desktop publishing   systems have reduced troff's relative   importance, but this tribute perfectly captures the strengths that secured   troff a place in hacker folklore; indeed,   it could be taken more generally as an indication of those qualities of   good programs that, in the long run, hackers most admire."

Among these are:\nThe assumption that dereferencing a null pointer is safe because it is allbits 0, and location 0 is readable and 0.  Problem: this may instead cause anillegal-address trap on non-VAXen, and even on VAXen under OSes other than BSDUnix.  Usually this is an implicit assumption of sloppy code (forgetting tocheck the pointer before using it), rather than deliberate exploitation of amisfeature.  \nThe assumption that characters are signed.  \nThe assumption that a pointer to any one type can freely be cast into apointer to any other type.  A stronger form of this is the assumption that allpointers are the same size and format, which means you don't have to worryabout getting the casts or types correct in calls.  Problem: this fails onword-oriented machines or others with multiple pointer formats.\nThe assumption that the parameters of a routine are stored in memory, on astack, contiguously, and in strictly ascending or descending order.  Problem:this fails on many RISC architectures.  \nThe assumption that pointer and integer types are the same size, and thatpointers can be stuffed into integer variables (and vice-versa) and drawn backout without being truncated or mangled.  Problem: this fails on segmentedarchitectures or word-oriented machines with funny pointer formats.\nThe assumption that a data type of any size may begin at any byte address inmemory (for example, that you can freely construct and dereference a pointerto a word- or greater-sized object at an odd char address).  Problem: thisfails on many (esp. RISC) architectures better optimized forHLL execution speed, and can cause an illegal addressfault or bus error.  \nThe (related) assumption that there is no padding at the end of types and thatin an array you can thus step right from the last byte of a previous componentto the first byte of the next one.  This is not only machine- butcompiler-dependent.  \nThe assumption that memory address space is globally flat and that the arrayreference foo[-1] is necessarily valid.Problem: this fails at 0, or other places on segment-addressed machines likeIntel chips (yes, segmentation is universally considered abrain-damaged way to design machines (seemoby), but that is a separate issue).\nThe assumption that objects can be arbitrarily large with no specialconsiderations.  Problem: this fails on segmented architectures and undernon-virtual-addressing environments.  \nThe assumption that the stack can be as large as memory.  Problem: this failson segmented architectures or almost anything else without virtual addressingand a paged stack.  \nThe assumption that bits and addressable units within an object are ordered inthe same way and that this order is a constant of nature.  Problem: this failson big-endian machines.  \nThe assumption that it is meaningful to compare pointers to different objectsnot located within the same array, or to objects of different types.  Problem:the former fails on segmented architectures, the latter on word-orientedmachines or others with multiple pointer formats.  \nThe assumption that an int is 32 bits, or (nearly equivalently)the assumption that sizeof(int) ==sizeof(long).  Problem: this fails on PDP-11s, 286-based systems andeven on 386 and 68000 systems under some compilers (and on 64-bit systems likethe Alpha, of course).  \nThe assumption that argv[] iswritable. Problem: this fails in many embedded-systems C environments and evenunder a few flavors of Unix.  \nNote that a programmer can validly be accused of vaxocentrism even if   he or she has never seen a VAX.  Some of these   assumptions (esp. 2--5) were valid on the PDP-11,   the original C machine, and became endemic years before the VAX.

Nevertheless vi (and variants   such as vim and elvis) is still widely used (about half the respondents in   a 1991 Usenet poll preferred it), and even EMACS fans often resort to it as   a mail editor and for small editing jobs (mainly because it starts up   faster than the bulkier versions of EMACS).

When these programs are executed, the embedded virus   is executed too, thus propagating the \u2018infection\u2019.  This   normally happens invisibly to the user.  Unlike a   worm, a virus cannot infect other computers without   assistance.  It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading programs   with their friends (see SEX).  The virus may do   nothing but propagate itself and then allow the program to run normally.   Usually, however, after propagating silently for a while, it starts doing   things like writing cute messages on the terminal or playing strange tricks   with the display (some viruses include nice display   hacks).  Many nasty viruses, written by particularly perversely   minded crackers, do irreversible damage, like nuking   all the user's files.\nIn the 1990s, viruses became a serious problem, especially among   Windows users; the lack of security on these machines enables viruses to   spread easily, even infecting the operating system (Unix machines, by   contrast, are immune to such attacks).  The production of special   anti-virus software has become an industry, and a number of exaggerated   media reports have caused outbreaks of near hysteria among users; many   lusers tend to blame everything   that doesn't work as they had expected on virus attacks.  Accordingly, this   sense of virus has passed not only   into techspeak but into also popular usage (where it is often incorrectly   used to denote a worm or even a Trojan   horse).

Overuse of terms from   this lexicon is often an indication of the wannabee   nature.  Compare newbie.\nHistorical note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different   flavor now (1993) than it did ten or fifteen years ago.  When the people   who are now hackerdom's tribal elders were in larval   stage, the process of becoming a hacker was largely unconscious   and unaffected by models known in popular culture \u2014 communities   formed spontaneously around people who, as   individuals, felt irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, and   what wannabees experienced was a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to   become similarly wizardly.  Those days of innocence are gone forever;   society's adaptation to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980 included   the elevation of the hacker as a new kind of folk hero, and the result is   that some people semi-consciously set out to be   hackers and borrow hackish prestige by fitting the popular image   of hackers.  Fortunately, to do this really well, one has to actually   become a wizard.

The wumpus lived   somewhere in a cave with the topology of an dodecahedron's edge/vertex   graph (later versions supported other topologies, including an icosahedron   and M\ufffdbius strip). The player started somewhere at random in the cave   with five \u2018crooked arrows\u2019; these could be shot through up to   three connected rooms, and would kill the wumpus on a hit (later versions   introduced the wounded wumpus, which got very angry).  Unfortunately for   players, the movement necessary to map the maze was made hazardous not   merely by the wumpus (which would eat you if you stepped on him) but also   by bottomless pits and colonies of super bats that would pick you up and   drop you at a random location (later versions added \u2018anaerobic   termites\u2019 that ate arrows, bat migrations, and earthquakes that   randomly changed pit locations).\nThis game appears to have been the first to use a non-random   graph-structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like the even older   Star Trek games).  In this respect, as in the dungeon-like setting and its   terse, amusing messages, it prefigured ADVENT and   Zork and was directly ancestral to the latter (Zork   acknowledged this heritage by including a super-bat colony).

If you type xyzzy at the appropriate time, you can move   instantly between two otherwise distant points.  If, therefore, you   encounter some bit of magic, you might remark on   this quite succinctly by saying simply \u201cXyzzy!\u201d   \u201cOrdinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has   protected it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will let you   do it anyway.\u201d \u201cXyzzy!\u201d It's traditional for xyzzy to   be an Easter egg in games with text   interfaces.\nXyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op command   on several OSes; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it would typically   respond \u201cNothing happens\u201d, just as   ADVENT did if the magic was invoked at the wrong   spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled the word.  In   more recent 32-bit versions, by the way, AOS/VS responds \u201cTwice as   much happens\u201d.\nEarly versions of the popular \u2018minesweeper\u2019 game under   Microsoft Windows had a cheat mode triggered by the command   \u2018xyzzy<enter><right-shift>\u2019 that turns the top-left   pixel of the screen different colors depending on whether or not the cursor   is over a bomb.  This feature temporarily disappeared in Windows 98, but   reappeared in Windows 2000.\nThe following passage from The Wonderful Wizard of   Oz by L. Frank Baum, suggesting a possible pre-ADVENT origin,   has recently come to light: \u201cZiz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\u201d said   Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.
